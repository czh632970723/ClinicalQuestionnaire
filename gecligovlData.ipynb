Primary liver cancer is a common malignancy worldwide. Laparoscopic liver resection has become increasingly popular due to its minimally invasive nature. During open and laparoscopic liver resection surgery, ICG, a fluorescent dye, is widely used to visualize liver segments and define tumor margins. However, there is a lack of high-level evidence regarding the timing and dosage of ICG administration in current protocols. In our preliminary study, we discovered a new method of pre-mixing ICG with albumin, which creates a more stable conjugate that could enhance fluorescence imaging during NIR laparoscopic hepatectomy. This study will include 100 patients with primary liver malignancies who are scheduled for laparoscopic anatomical hepatic resection. The patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the new ICG-albumin protocol (experimental group) or the standard ICG alone protocol (control group). The primary outcome will be the efficacy of fluorescence imaging, which will be evaluated using a 5-point scoring system by three independent experts. Secondary outcomes will include operation time, blood loss, tumor margin status, complications, length of stay, long-term recurrence, and survival.\\n\\nThe hypothesis of this study is that pre-binding ICG with albumin creates a more stabilized fluorescent complex, which could significantly improve the efficacy of fluorescence navigation and hepatectomy outcomes compared to standard ICG alone. This study aims to provide high-quality evidence on optimal protocols for ICG use in laparoscopic fluorescent image-guided liver surgery. The results of this study could help establish standardized guidelines to improve the application of this important navigation technique and enhance surgical precision and outcomes for liver cancer patients worldwide.

Many initiatives have been taken to reduce postoperative morbidity. As such, prehabilitation programmes are increasingly used for patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Improvement of aerobic fitness has been proven to reduce complication rates, especially in high-risk patients (those with a low preoperative aerobic capacity). Different conceptual hypotheses exist of the underlying mechanism of variability in postoperative complications and prehabilitation response. One of the complementary rationales focusses on homeostasis-allostasis before and after surgery, more specifically on the preoperative aerobic capacity to meet postoperative metabolic demands. However, more insight in postoperative metabolic demands (energy expenditure) during in-hospital recovery from major abdominal surgery in relation to preoperative resting metabolic demands and maximal aerobic capacity is essential to understand the increase in metabolic demands coinciding with major surgery in relation to the body's reserve capacity. This information can be used to better understand the rationale behind exercise prehabilitation, as well as to optimize the content of preoperative treatment for unfit patients, for instance by means of personalized prehabilitation programs that might improve postoperative outcomes.\\n\\nObjective: This study aims to explore the difference of pre- and postoperative energy expenditure in patients undergoing major elective liver resection and relate this to their preoperative aerobic capacity.\\n\\nStudy design: The study will be a prospective observational study with thorough pre- and postoperative measurements of energy expenditure.

Unfortunately, the surgery is not always an option, as in same patients the future remnant liver (FRL) is too small to supply all the functions. Therefore, some additional methods have been proposed to increase the size of the FRL.\\n\\nThe aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of three methods of increasing the future remnant liver - Portal Vein Embolization (PVE) - embolization of one of the portal branches; Liver Vein Deprivation (LVD) - embolization both of the portal branch as well as the hepatic vein; and partial ALPPS (Associating Liver Partition and Portal vein Ligation for Staged hepatectomy) - ligation of portal vein branch with partial liver transection.\\n\\nThe efficacy of those three methods will be assessed both by analyzing the volumetric increase (by computer tomography scans) and by functional increase (by 99mTc-mebrofenin scintigraphy). Functional assessment of the liver hypertrophy seems to be of crucial importance, as some of the previous studies suggest that there might be a significant discrepancy in the increase of size comparing to the increase of function.\\n\\nThis is a prospective, interventional randomized study. The study group (154 patients) will consist of patients being considered as candidates for major hepatic resection, after inducing hypertrophy of the future remnant liver.\\n\\nThe primary study hypothesis is greater efficacy of ALPPS in preparing patients for large hepatic resection by inducing hypertrophy of the future remnant liver, as compared both to PVE and LVD.\\n\\nIn case of unsuccessful induction of hypertrophy by the embolization techniques, patients may be qualified to rescue ALPPS procedure.\\n\\nPrimary end-point:\\n\\nPercentage of patients with successful resection (patients, who gained sufficient increase of the FRL to proceed to the liver resection) with no post-surgical 90-day mortality.\\n\\nSecondary end-points:\\n\\n1. the rate and degree of volume increase in different groups\\n2. the rate and degree of functional increase in different groups\\n3.

Even when liver cancer is suspected by blood tests, imaging is required to determine the location, size, and extent of disease. Medical societies therefore recommend surveillance with ultrasound every 6 months in at-risk patients. However, a key challenge to improving the survival is that ultrasound may miss half of early-stage liver cancers, thus diagnosis must rely on additional tests such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or biopsy. Hence, there is a clear need to improve the ability to detect liver cancers, especially with ultrasound. The investigator's team proposes novel ultrasound approaches to detect cancer nodules invisible on conventional ultrasound based on differences in mechanical and structural properties between liver and tumor. Improving detection is critical because liver cancer can be cured only if detected at an early stage, as shown by improvements in survival rates in patients enrolled in surveillance programs. The investigator's multi-disciplinary, national, and international team includes experts in clinical fields (hepatology, oncology, radiology, pathology), basic sciences (engineering, medical physics, machine learning, biostatistics), and patient partnership.

The liver is the most common metastatic organ of colorectal cancer, and palliative chemotherapy is the only option for most ICRLM patients.

Liver transplantation is an ideal choice for patients with ICRLM, which can significantly improve the postoperative survival rate.

Especially after the failure of first-line or second-line system treatment, the prognosis of those patients is extremely poor, with the median OS of only 3.5 months. Even in combination with molecular targeted drugs such as cetuximab or bevacizumab, the median tumor-free survival period is only 4.8-6.8 months, and OS is only 11-15 months. When they have disease progression, treatment is currently a difficult clinical problem. Regofinib is a new targeted drug for the third-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer in recent years. However, in the prospective multicenter clinical study, compared with the placebo group, the extended OS is only 1.4 months, which is not so satisfactory. How to improve the survival of these advanced patients with drug resistance is an important clinical problem to be solved urgently. Minimally invasive local treatment may be a promising way to solve this problem. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) are currently the most widely used methods in clinical practice. In theory, TACE combined with HAIC can control small metastasis and embolic residual lesions. The combination of TACE and HAIC can improve the curative effect. Whether the combination of TACE, HAIC and Regofinib can be expected to achieve the effect of 1+1+1\\\\>3 in CRLM patients who have failed the previous second-line chemotherapy remains unknown.

As a result, blood clots are a major cause of complications and death following liver surgery. This is especially true in cancer patients who are at a higher risk of developing blood clots. Current methods for preventing clotting complications after liver surgery include conventional coagulation blood tests (CCTs) and anticoagulant drugs, such as low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). Current LMWH treatment is prescribed for one month after surgery, but studies show that the risk of developing blood clots can last up to 3 months.

This research study uses special immune system cells called CARE T cells, a new experimental treatment.\\n\\nThe body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.\\n\\nInvestigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene (a tiny part of what makes-up DNA and carries a person's traits) into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In the lab, investigators made several genes called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called GPC3. The antibody GPC3 recognizes a protein found solid tumors including pediatric liver cancers. This CAR is called GPC3-CAR. To make this CAR more effective, investigators also added two genes that includes IL15 and IL21, which are protein that helps CAR T cells grow better and stay in the blood longer so that they may kill tumors better. The mixture of GPC3-CAR and IL15 plus IL21 killed tumor cells better in the laboratory when compared with CAR T cells that did not have IL15 plus IL21 .This study will test T cells that investigators made (called genetic engineering) with GPC3-CAR and the IL15 plus IL21 (CARE T cells) in patients with GPC3-positive solid tumors.\\n\\nT cells made to carry a gene called iCasp9 can be killed when they encounter a specific drug called AP1903. The investigators will insert the iCasp9 and IL15 plus IL21 together into the T cells using a virus that has been made for this study. The drug (AP1903) is an experimental drug that has been tested in humans with no bad side-effects.

Due to its well-known efficacy for tumor ablation (i.e. hepatocarcinoma) it use has been extended in some cases to ablate the liver surface after resection in questionable resection. Till date, despite the majority of surgeons apply an additional coagulation in doubtful margins, there is not an evidence that this maneuver really decreases the local recurrence or increases the overall survival. On the contrary, some studies have suggested that non-anatomical resections in order to spare liver parenchyma could lead to major zones of liver ischemia in the remnant liver and thus favoring recurrence. However, major liver ischemia (defined as grade 2 o more) is unlikely to be provoked by 1 cm-depth additional coagulation of the margin.\\n\\nThe investigators previously published in a retrospective study the concept of additional margin coagulation within liver resections and narrow margins and demonstrated that the study group had significantly less local recurrence compared to the controls.

Its indications are mainly secondary malignant lesions, then primary malignant lesions, benign lesions and septic resections. Around a hundred major hepatectomies are carried out every year in Strasbourg. This surgery is burdened by 4.5% mortality at day 90 and 20 to 50% morbidity. The main intraoperative risks are hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability. Surgical vascular clamping helps reduce the risk of bleeding but is responsible for sometimes major hemodynamic variations, ischemia-reperfusion syndromes and can lead to acute post-operative liver failure. Recent literature attests to the safety of liver resection without vascular clamping, which is why it is less and less practiced.\\n\\nDifferent elements are identified as independent risk factors for morbidity and mortality: the presence of cirrhosis, portal embolization, history of renal or cardiac failure, duration of vascular clamping, resected liver volume, transfusion of products labile blood and associated surgical procedures.\\n\\nGiven the significant risk of intra- and post-operative complications, it seems relevant to analyze pre- and intra-operative data in order to highlight risk factors for vascular clamping.

No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells.\\n\\nAntibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.\\n\\nIn order to get them to kill cancers more effectively, in the laboratory, the study team inserted a new gene called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) into T cells that makes them recognize cancer cells and kill them. When inserted, this new CAR T cell can specifically recognize a protein found on solid tumors, called glypican-3 (GPC3). To make this GPC3-CAR more effective, the study team also added two genes called IL15 and IL21 that help CAR T cells grow better and stay in the blood longer so that they may kill tumors better. When the study team did this in the laboratory, they found that this mixture of GPC3-CAR,IL15 and IL21 killed tumor cells better when compared with CAR T cells that did not have IL15 plus IL21 in the laboratory. This study will use those cells, which are called 21.15.GPC3-CAR T cells, to treat patients with solid tumors that have GPC3 on their surface.\\n\\nThe study team also wanted to make sure that they could stop the 21.15.GPC3-CAR T cells from growing in the blood should there be any bad side effects. In order to do so, they inserted a gene called iCasp9 into the FAST-CAR T cells. This allows us the elimination of 21.15.GPC3-CAR T cells in the blood when the gene comes into contact with a medication called AP1903. The drug (AP1903) is an experimental drug that has been tested in humans with no bad side-effects. This drug will only be used to kill the T cells if necessary due to side effects .\\n\\nThe study team has treated patients with T cells that include GPC3. Patients have also been treated with IL-21 and with IL-15. Patients have not been treated with a combination of T cells that contain GPC3, IL-21 and IL-15.

Large scale transcriptional profiling of primary CRC tumors has revealed the presence of four distinct consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs). The CMS4 subtype is associated with a poor prognosis, especially in early CRC, and may benefit less from several standard systemic treatments (e.g. oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, cetuximab), while being relatively sensitive to irinotecan. This is relevant as in the metastatic setting often the first choice first-line systemic therapy regimen is oxaliplatin and not irinotecan-based. Furthermore, tumor cells can acquire a CMS4 phenotype following exposure to chemotherapy, which may contribute to therapy resistance.\\n\\nCMS4 accounts for \\\\~25% of all early-stage CRC patients and is more prevalent in advanced disease stages (\\\\~40% in stage IV CRC). Currently available CMS4 diagnostic tests require tumor tissue samples. The interpretation of biopsy-based CMS4 diagnosis is however complicated by large intra- and inter-lesion heterogeneity of CMS4 status. Extensive biopsy protocols could address the problem of CMS4 heterogeneity but are challenging in routine clinical practice. The development of CMS4-targeted therapy strategies therefore requires a more robust and clinically applicable diagnostic test for comprehensive quantitative assessment of CMS4 status of all lesions - primary and metastatic - in individual cancer patients.\\n\\nA promising solution for such a diagnostic test is to use a radiotracer that enables the quantitative assessment of CMS4 in vivo by whole body molecular imaging. This technique is particularly suited to assess biomarkers with heterogeneous expression: for diagnostic purposes, as a companion diagnostic for (targeted) therapies, or as part of a 'theranostic' strategy where patient selection using the diagnostic radiotracer is followed by treatment with the same tracer labeled to a therapeutic compound.\\n\\nRadiolabeled fibroblast activating protein inhibitor (FAPI) is an emerging diagnostic radiotracer that allows the comprehensive whole-body, whole-tumor assessment of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expression in humans with a very low background uptake also at frequent CRC metastatic sites including the liver. FAP is an excellent candidate molecular imaging target for CMS4, as it is highly expressed on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) that are abundantly present in this CRC subtype. Indeed, the investigators found that FAP gene-expression measured in tumor biopsies - as a single marker - accurately discriminates CMS4 from other CRC subtypes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.91; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90-0.93). The FoCus study will aim to take a next step by relating in vivo assessed FAP protein-expression by \\\\[18F\\\\]-ALF-FAPI-74 positron emission tomography (PET) / computed tomography (CT) to CMS4 status in patients eligible for colorectal liver metastatectomy as a first proof of concept. Ultimately this will contribute to the development of a diagnostic tool for the comprehensive assessment of CMS4 load in patients with (metastatic) CRC by using \\\\[18F\\\\]-ALF-FAPI-74 PET/CT molecular imaging, to guide CMS4 subtype-directed therapy decisions.\", 'InclusionCriteria': '\\n\\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\\n* Candidates for liver metastatectomy at the time of liver metastasis diagnosis as clinically indicated in the tumor board (RAKU).\\n* Patients must have given written informed consent.\\n* At least one liver metastasis should have a longest diameter of a least 1.5 cm as measured on routinely performed imaging (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging, CT-scan or ultrasound). This minimum diameter will guarantee sufficient tissue material for analysis and will prevent underestimation of \\\\[18F\\\\]-ALF-FAPI-74 uptake due to partial volume effects.\\n* CRC patients who received prior treatment before clinical indication for surgical liver metastases resection (both synchronous and metachronous patients, as well as a re-resection of liver metastatic disease) are allowed to enter the study. This is because our prime interest is in the relation between FAPI uptake and the presence of CMS4 at the same point in time, which will likely not be biased by earlier therapies.\\n* It is allowed for patients to receive concurrent radiofrequency ablation or other local treatments directed to other metastatic disease locations, if at least one liver metastasis of sufficient size is planned to be surgically removed and therefore available for tissue analysis.\\n* It is allowed for patients to be treated with pre-surgical radiotherapy directed to the primary tumor (e.g. in rectal cancer patients).\\n\\n', 'ExclusionCriteria': '\\n\\n* Pregnancy.\\n* Patients treated with a pre-surgical chemotherapy regimen that does not include a fluoropyrimidine.', 'Interventions': {'devices': [], 'drugs': [], 'produce': [], 'behavior': [], 'other': [], 'conbinationproduct': [], 'dietary_supplement': []}}\n",

The majority of primary liver cancers occur as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the incidence of which is increasing in many parts of the world. The vast majority of HCC cases occur in the setting of liver cirrhosis, usually due to chronic viral infections with hepatitis C or hepatitis B, alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or diabetes.

This radioactive isotope (Lu-177) is attached to a molecule called dotatate. On the surface of GEP-NET tumor cells, a receptor called a somatostatin receptor binds to dotatate. When this binding occurs, the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate drug then enters somatostatin receptor-positive tumor cells, and radiation emitted by Lu-177 helps kill the cells.

Besides the well-established ability to increase the rate of transplantability of extended criteria donors (ECD) and donors after cardiac death (DCD), the use of machine perfusion (MP) may also improve the oncological outcomes of patients affected by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing liver transplantation (LT). The underlying mechanism is represented by the modulation of the ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)-related cellular damage obtained by the liver graft perfusion with HOPE before LT. The identification of biomarkers able to predict graft outcomes and highlight the mechanism of graft injury before transplantation rapidly and in non-invasive manner is therefore needed. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has already shown its potential by using perfusion liquids or pre-implantation biopsies.\\n\\nThe aim of the investigators is to run an open-label, randomised, controlled trial to study the impact of treating standard liver grafts from brain dead donors (DBD) with HOPE before liver transplant in patients affected by HCC.

Presence of extra-hepatic disease and general contraindications to liver transplantation as defined by the local tumor board are considered as exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) with the use of a dedicated software to MP (intervention group) or no-MP (control group) before liver transplantation. Untargeted mass spectrometry metabolomics (UHPLC-HRMS) will be performed on liver graft perfusate, liver graft biopsy and recipient blood samples, to identify by classification methods, novel predictive markers of IRI. Furthermore, rapid targeted MS approaches will be performed on VIP metabolites and known key compounds (such as TCA, aminoacids, energy metabolism) to rapidly assess graft function as well as post-operative outcome.\\n\\nBlood samples of the recipient will be collected at two checkpoints (listing, and 3 months after liver transplant) to evaluate exosomes and miRNA expression fluctuations (liquid biopsy).\\n\\nPrimary outcomes of the study will be overall survival, graft survival and recurrence-free survival at 1- and 2-years.

Cancer-related deaths can be reduced if patients are diagnosed and treated early. Delay in cancer diagnosis can occur at any point along the diagnostic spectrum, from the first observation of symptoms to the start of treatment. Diagnosing cancer when it is still at an early stage, before it has spread, gives surgery, radiotherapy and other treatments the best chance of working.\\n\\nTherefore, early diagnosis is the most important way to improve cancer outcomes.\\n\\nMost of the cancers usually presents with vague and non-alarming symptoms. Most individuals are diagnosed late when the cancer has already spread, and the prognosis is poor. There are over 200 different types of cancer that can cause many different signs and symptoms. Sometimes symptoms affect specific body areas, such as abdomen or skin. But signs can also be more general, and include weight loss, tiredness (fatigue) or unexplained pain. The type of symptoms varies from person to person.\\n\\nThe major reasons for not presenting to the GP with symptoms such as these are \"not wanting to waste the GP\\'s time\" and normalisation of these symptoms. The persistence of a symptom, social influence and awareness encourage help-seeking behaviours in primary care. However, few believe their symptom(s) might be a sign of cancer. Consequently, people might choose to self-manage their symptoms by using over-the-counter medication, and to seek advice from other sources, (pharmacists, family, internet), rather than a primary care physician.\\n\\nRATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY An early cancer diagnosis is essential for receiving treatment as early as possible to have the best chance for successful treatment. Early diagnosis of cancer can be challenging. Sometimes, the cancer symptoms resemble common illnesses and could resolve with the use of over-the-counter medications and other remedies until they become persistent or debilitating. The present study focuses on ten cancer forms: colon, oesophageal, stomach, liver, bladder, uterine, vulval, ovarian, endometrial and pancreatic. Patients diagnosed with the cancers mentioned above often report experiencing vague symptoms (such as abdominal or back pain, indigestion, feeling full etc). They often use over-the-counter medication to manage their symptoms before seeing a doctor.\\n\\nInformation about how often and what products participants purchase (e.g. pain killers, digestive products and natural remedies) to care for these symptoms could help identify these cancers a few crucial weeks or months earlier and encourage people to seek help sooner from their doctors.', 'InclusionCriteria': '\\n\\n* Individuals, at least 18 years old, recently diagnosed and living with any of the mentioned cancer forms (colon, oesophageal, stomach, liver, bladder, uterine, vulval, ovarian, endometrial and pancreatic), diagnosed up to 2 years prior, at the latest and having loyalty card of at least one participating high street retailer in their household, are eligible to join the CLOCS-2 as cases.\\n* Individuals, at least 18 years old, who have not been diagnosed with any of these cancer forms and having at least one participating high street retailer loyalty card in their household, are eligible to join the CLOCS-2 as controls\\n\\n', 'ExclusionCriteria': '\\n\\n* Individuals under the age of 18 years.', 'Interventions': {'devices': [], 'drugs': [], 'produce': [], 'behavior': [], 'other': ['Cases & Controls'], 'conbinationproduct': [], 'dietary_supplement': []}}\n",

However, resistance to ICI is increasingly encountered in clinical practice in HCC patients.\\n\\nVarious approaches are currently evaluated in clinical setting to tackle acquired resistance during treatment of ICIs in HCC.\\n\\nOur group has a track record of studying the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in mediating resistance to ICI in HCC. First, based on single-cell sequencing data of serial biopsy of tumor in our phase II clinical trial on pembrolizumab in HCC (NCT03419481), the investigators reveal an upregulation of class 1 HDAC in patients with acquired resistance to pembrolizumab, which was associated with reduced lymphoid/myeloid cellular ratio in the tumor. Further, the investigators showed that HDAC8, a class 1 HDAC, could diminish the efficacy of anti-programmed cell death (ligand)-1 (PD\\\\[L\\\\]-1) by the mechanism of T-cell exclusion from the tumor environment (SciTranl Med. 2021;13:online). Finally, the investigators combine CXD101, a potent selective class I HDAC inhibitor, with anti-PD(L)-1 in orthotopic immunocompetent HCC mouse model with resistance to anti-PD(L)-1 treatment and find that the combination regimen could reverse the resistance phenotype and significantly improve survivals of mice than either CXD101 or anti-PD(L)-1 alone.', 'InclusionCriteria': '\\n\\n* Diagnosis of HCC according to the AASLD guideline20\\n* Prior treatment with systemic treatment consisting of immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD1, anti-PDL1 or anti-CTLA4)\\n* The duration of previous ICI must be 6 weeks or longer to avoid chance of pseudo-progression\\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0-1\\n* Adequate hematological function:\\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x109/L; Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L and Hemoglobin ≥ 8g/dL\\n* Adequate renal function:\\n* Urine protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 1 mg/mg (≤ 113.1 mg/mmol) or 24-hour urine protein \\\\< 1g\\n* Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min (according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation)\\n* Adequate hepatic function parameters:\\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL (≤ 34.2 μmol/L)\\n* Serum albumin ≥ 2.8 g/dL (≥ 28 g/L)\\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\\\< 3.0 upper limit of normal (ULN)\\n\\n', 'ExclusionCriteria': '\\n\\n* Previous development of severe autoimmune complications from immune checkpoint inhibitors\\n* History of moderate to sever autoimmune disease requiring steroid use\\n* History of organ transplant\\n* Prior use of lenvatinib or sorafenib\\n* Disease involvement/thrombosis of major vessels (including main trunk of portal vein, inferior vena cava or pulmonary artery)\\n* More than two lines of systemic therapy (i.e., study treatment must be second-line or third-line treatment)\\n* Clinically significant bleeding events (eg.. esophageal varices) within 3 months\\n* Moderate or severe ascites\\n* Child-pugh B or C hepatic function\\n* Systolic blood pressure of 200mmHg or higher\\n* Pregnant or lactating females', 'Interventions': {'devices': [], 'drugs': ['Zabadinostat (CXD101) and Geptanolimab', 'Lenvatinib and Sorafenib'], 'produce': [], 'behavior': [], 'other': [], 'conbinationproduct': [], 'dietary_supplement': []}}\n",

These adults will include people who already received their usual treatment and who have had a certain type of imaging scan before the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\\n\\nMetastatic pancreatic cancer is a cancer that starts in the pancreas, a gland that helps to digest food, and has spread to other parts of the body. Pancreatic cancer most commonly spreads to the liver (called liver metastasis). Gadoxetate sodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) is a type of imaging technique that uses a specific dye called gadoxetate sodium to produce clearer images of the liver.\\n\\nParticipants with pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery only if their cancer has not spread to other parts of the body. Therefore, it is important to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body before performing surgery. To do this, different imaging scans such as exploratory laparoscopy and CE-CT are used. However, these tests have certain limitations, such as complicated procedures or, in some cases inaccurate results.\\n\\nSome studies suggest that performing EOB-MRI along with a regular CT scan may improve the chances of finding out if pancreatic cancer has spread to the liver. This imaging technique is especially helpful in detecting smaller tumors that may be missed in other types of scan. However, more information is needed to better understand the impact of EOB-MRI in Japanese people under real-world conditions.\\n\\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn more about how using EOB-MRI helps in deciding the treatment options, how well the participants do, and how much does the use of medical care facilities costs.\\n\\nThe main information that researchers will collect in this study:\\n\\nparticipant characteristics, including age, sex, whether they smoke or not, how well they can manage daily tasks, any other health problems they have, how advanced their cancer is, and if they have undergone laparoscopy\\n\\nthe length of time:\\n\\nfrom the date of diagnosis of pancreatic cancer until a participant dies (called overall survival)\\n\\nfrom the date of first treatment for pancreatic cancer until the cancer spreads of other organs\\n\\nfrom the date of diagnosis of pancreatic cancer to starting the first treatment\\n\\nfrom the date of first treatment for pancreatic cancer to starting the second treatment option\\n\\ntreatments that the participants have received, including anti-cancer drugs, radiation, and surgery\\n\\nthe number of hospital visits, use of healthcare facilities, and related costs.\\n\\nThe information in this study will be grouped based on the participants who had an EOB-MRI and those who had non EOB-MRI.\\n\\nThe data will come from the participants' information stored in a database called Medical Data Vision (MDV) in Japan.

Studies have shown that history of biliary tract disease, tumor size, embolization materials and embolization endpoint selection may be related to the occurrence of abscess. In recent years, with the wide application of targeted and immune drugs, there have been reports of multiple cases of liver abscess after single target immunotherapy for liver cancer, and there have also been studies showing that TACE combined with targeted immunotherapy can significantly increase the degree of liquefaction necrosis and increase the risk of liver abscess. However, these studies are single-center reports with small sample size and low level of evidence. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to explore the risk factors of liver abscess after TACE and build a prediction model by using multi-center and large sample data. The formation of liver abscess after TACE means a large range of tissue liquefaction necrosis. There are reports of high incidence of early recurrence and metastasis of liquefaction necrosis. Some studies also show that tumor necrosis is more complete when liver abscess is combined with complete remission. In previous studies, ORR in patients with liver cancer complicated with liver abscess ranged from 18.75%-100%, with significant differences in reports from different centers. The effect of specific abscess formation on TACE efficacy of liver cancer remains to be determined.

Sorafenib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, initially set the standard, followed by approvals for lenvatinib, regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab. Immunotherapy, particularly combinations like atezolizumab with bevacizumab, has shown superior efficacy over sorafenib. Despite these advances, second-line therapies offer limited progression-free survival (mPFS: 2-3 months), necessitating new approaches. Radiotherapy, bolstered by technological advancements, has shown promise. Techniques like stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) combined with PD-1 inhibitors achieve significant response rates and survival benefits.

Current treatment modalities involve tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) characterized by a low response rate and often poor tolerability. Encouraging findings from the Imbrave 150 study, demonstrating increased survival rates coupled with favorable treatment tolerance, prompt the investigators to consider the potential of offering the combination of treatment with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab (Atezo-Beva) to patients with LT. No data regarding the safety and efficacy of this new combination are available for patients with LT as they were not included in Imbrave 150. Immunosuppression after LT is low when compared to essentially all other organ recipients, liver recipients are considered with lower immunological risk. However, the use of ICIs has been associated with a risk of hepatic rejection in LT patients. In this study, in order to prevent acute cellular rejection (ACR) occurrence, we propose to adopt a standardized immunosuppressive regimen closed to the one used immediately after LT but with lower therapeutic goals for tacrolimus and everolimus to allow immunotherapy treatment to be effective.

There are two National Health Service (NHS) PBT treatment centres in the United Kingdom (UK), in Manchester and London. The NHS is committed to ensuring the best use of this limited resource by investigating which patients will benefit from PBT.\\n\\nEvaluative Commissioning in Protons (ECIP) is a programme of studies exploring the role of PBT in different types of cancer. The studies are funded by NHS England. ECIP studies are not randomised studies, which means that all eligible patients will be offered PBT. Any eligible patient in the UK can be referred, and accommodation is available for patients who don't live close to a PBT centre.\\n\\nThe main benefit of PBT, compared with standard photon radiotherapy, is the predicted reduction in radiation dose to surrounding healthy tissues. With photon radiotherapy, some radiation passes beyond the target area, affecting healthy tissues and causing side-effects. With PBT, the radiation dose stops within the target area, causing less damage to surrounding tissues, and limiting side effects.\\n\\nEMPHATIC is a study within the ECIP programme. In EMPHATIC, the investigators are looking to see whether a combination of treatments, including PBT, chemotherapy and a liver transplant, can be used to treat patients with cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer).\\n\\nEMPHATIC offers patients whose cancer can't be removed with surgery (unresectable) a potentially curative treatment option. There is evidence that liver transplant is a curative treatment option in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. There is a risk that the cancer may grow or spread whilst waiting for a transplant, potentially making patients ineligible. PBT and chemotherapy is thought to be the best way to control the cancer, until a liver transplant can be performed.

Nevertheless, 15% of these patients still show tumour recurrence after LT. In a monocentric pilot study, we have demonstrated that specific changes in N-glycan profiles (measured before LT) occur in HCC patients receiving LT1. These specific changes proved to be strongly associated with the risk of HCC recurrence and overall death after LT, independent of the criteria used for stringent patient selection. Pathophysiologically, it is known that abberations in protein glycosylation are involved in the onset en development of HCC. As such, a prognostic biomarker was developed that can clearly differentiate between patients with and without increased risk of HCC recurrence.\\n\\nThe primary goal of this research study is to set up a prospective, multicentre study in order to validate the prognostic value of this glycomics-based serum biomarker. As such, the risk of tumour recurrence in patients undergoing LT for HCC will be estimated independent from the Milan criteria and the French alpha-fetoprotein model as the current standard. The secondary goal is to explore the potential of serum glycomics as markers of early recurrence after LT for HCC. More specifically, we aim to investigate whether serial glycomics determination at fixed time points after LT could allow early detection of recurrent HCC even before it is visible on conventional imaging. Consequently, a diagnostic biomarker for monitoring early recurrence after LT could be developed with the potential of redirecting treatment strategies already in an early disease stage.\\n\\nIn case the promising data from the pilot study will be confirmed, the prognostic biomarker could be implemented in daily clinical practice leading to optimization of patient selection using a simple blood test before LT. More specifically, this marker could improve organ allocation thus preventing unnessecary treatment toxicity for the patient and reducing the costs of treatment for society.

This is particularly valid when it comes to offering alternative treatment options for patients with advanced tumors that are chemo-refractory. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are 3 dimensional tumoroids that can be expanded ex vivo and are both pheno- and genotypically identical to patients' tumors. Observational studies have shown that PDO-based drug screens can predict treatment response with high sensitivity and specificity. Vlachogiannis G. reported a living biobank of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from patients with advanced GI cancers enrolled in clinical trials. PDOs can recapitulate patients' clinical response to chemotherapeutic agents. In 19 tumor organoids, the group performed molecular profiling and drug screens and then compared ex vivo organoid responses to anticancer drugs. Drug response to PDO based orthotopic mouse tumor xenografts correlated to the drug response of the patient in clinical trials. Further to the study, there were other retrospective validation studies utilizing PDOs from patients enrolled in clinical trials such as the TUMOROID, CinClare to predict clinical response. Ooft studied PDOs from patients with metastatic colorectal cancers enrolled in the TUMOROID study to predict response to irinotecan-based therapies. Yao generated a organoid biobank of 80 locally advanced rectal cancers. These patients were derived from a phase III study (CinClare) that compared neoadjuvant chemo-radiation using either capecitabine or CAPIRI. Response to chemoradiation in patients matched to that of rectal cancer organoids (sensitivity 78% and specificity 91.9%). In a systematic analysis of 17 studies (9 on advanced GI and pancreatic cancers, one on renal cell cancer and others on miscellaneous cancers), the pooled sensitivity and specificity for discriminating patients with a clinical response through PDO-based drug screen was 0.81 (95%CI 0.69-0.89) and 0.74 (95%CI 0.64-0.82) respectively. Within 4-6 weeks, PDO-based drug screen creates a true personalised platform by predicting patient-specific drug response with high accuracy. Recent technical advancements in growing these PDO 'avatars' from biopsies have made it possible to test suitable anticancer drugs in patients with advanced inoperable tumors, and explore the new possibilities for treatment options that otherwise would be missed by standard conventional therapies. In 2019, our group embarked on PDO research; investigators obtained tissues from patients with advanced/ inoperable solid tumors, and performing drug screens on these PDOs ex vivo. In several patients, investigators were able to identified drugs not otherwise used through sequencing data, and observed remarkable clinical response in patients with PDO responsive tumors. Investigators illustrate with cases that underwent PDO culture and drug screens. \\\\[ See appendix \\\\] In the literature, the clinical utility of treatment based on PDO informed drug options has however not been fully established.

These adults should be prescribed a different treatment after treatment with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, or another similar combination of drugs, by their doctors.\\n\\nUnresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) is a type of liver cancer that cannot be treated with surgery.\\n\\nIn the past, sorafenib was the only approved first-line anti-cancer drug for people with uHCC. Regorafenib and other drugs were approved as second-line treatments for uHCC if a person could not take sorafenib or it stopped working for them.\\n\\nLately, another first-line (1L) treatment called immuno-oncology (IO) immune checkpoint inhibitor combination (1L-IO combo), like atezolizumab with bevacizumab (AB), has become the preferred choice of treatment. This is because of the meaningful impact on patient survival. 1L-IO combo are drugs that help the body's defense system recognize and kill cancer cells.\\n\\nSince the other treatments were previously approved for use following sorafenib, the best order to take these treatments in following an 1L-IO combo is unknown.\\n\\nTo better understand and determine this order, more knowledge is needed about how well different treatments work in participants with uHCC who have been treated with AB or another 1L-IO combo.\\n\\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn more about how well different treatments work when given after first-line treatment with AB or another approved 1L-IO combo. To do this, researchers will collect data on how long the participants live (also called overall survival) from the start of any treatment given after the first-line treatment.\\n\\nIn addition, researchers will also collect the following information to learn more about the participants who will be given a different treatment after the 1L-IO combo:\\n\\n* characteristics including age, sex, and race, and signs and symptoms of the participants over the duration of their first-line treatment\\n* the length of time from the first to the last dose (also called duration of therapy) of the treatments given after the 1L-IO combo\\n* the length of time until a participant's cancer worsens, or they die (also called progression free survival) from the start of the treatments given after the 1L-IO combo\\n* the number of participants whose tumor completely disappears or shrinks (also called overall tumor response) after taking the treatments given after the 1L-IO combo\\n* the sequence of treatments given after the 1L-IO combo Data will be collected from September 2023 to December 2026 and cover a period of around 3 years. The data will be collected using medical records or by interviewing the participants during their routine visits to the doctor.\\n\\nResearchers will observe participants from the start of the treatment given after the 1L-IO combo until the end of their participation in the study.\\n\\nIn this study, only data from routine care will be collected.

HCC patients access to LT is not only determined by the underlying liver function but also by the alpha-fetoprotein (aFP) score which allows to better identify patients with high risk of recurrence. LT is the best curative treatment as it can cure both the tumor and the underlying liver disease. However, the access to LT is limited due to organ shortage and preserved liver function for the majority of the patients with HCC. Bridging therapies, such as ablation by radiofrequency (RF) or microwaves, or trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), are carried out routinely to prevent the risk of tumor progression and drop-out during the waiting time (the drop-out rate being 20%). Nevertheless, only 50 to 70% of patients in France will have access to these treatments due to specific contraindications.\\n\\nStereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as a non-invasive alternative and potentially efficient treatment of single or bilocular HCC. SBRT is a high-precision technique allowing to deliver a precise high dose irradiation on moving intrahepatic lesions. RTS is feasible only when the hepatic reserve is sufficient to avoid radic hepatitis.\\n\\nAdvantages of SBRT, as compared to TACE or RF, are 1) to preserve the hepatic artery, which can be altered by TACE 2) to allow access to complex tumors locations or superficial lesions not feasible by RF 3) to avoid any tumor spread related to punctures 4) to avoid general anesthesia.\\n\\nHowever, SBRT has not been validated as bridging therapy before LT in a prospective study.

Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) affects about 0.3% of adults. GHD, common post-pituitary tumor surgery or radiotherapy, disrupts lipid metabolism, increasing triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol while decreasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This is especially severe in GH adenoma patients, whose lipid metabolism issues worsen post-surgery, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis. Fat accumulates in the liver first, making liver fat content a key early indicator of metabolic disorders, which can lead to diabetes and atherosclerosis. Early intervention is crucial as liver fat deposition in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is reversible.\\n\\nRecombinant human growth hormone can treat GHD-related lipid metabolism disorders, but research on its effects on liver fat in post-surgery GH adenoma patients is limited. The investigators plan to treat these patients with 1 mg/week of recombinant human growth hormone for 24 weeks, aiming to normalize insulin-like growth factor-1 levels. Liver fat content changes will be measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) and Fibroscan. Changes in weight, BMI, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, blood lipids, and other metabolic factors will also be evaluated to assess treatment efficacy and safety.\\n\\nZhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Fudan University, performs over 300 pituitary tumor surgeries annually, including 100 GH adenoma cases.

Despite surgical resection in appropriate patients, many patients recur.\\n\\nThe results of the IMbrave150 study have established PD-L1 inhibition in combination with VEGF inhibition as a new standard of care highlighting the role of immune checkpoint inhibition in advanced HCC. In addition, the combination of Tremelimumab and Durvalumab has demonstrated efficacy in advanced HCC; the HIMALAYA trial has now completed accrual in treatment naïve patients with advanced HCC. Furthermore the earlier use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in this disease are being explored with adjuvant combination strategies, including the EMERALD-2 trial (NCT03847428). Neoadjuvant treatment in HCC allows for delivery of treatment pre surgery and may enhance pathological responses and improve outcomes. The delivery of combination CTLA-4 and PD-L1 inhibition has demonstrated efficacy in other tumour types in the neoadjuvant setting where the impact on the tumour microenvironment has also been evaluated.

Patients will receive pre-op: 1 dose Tremelimumab (300mg) (T300) with Durvalumab (1500mg) at cycle 1 and 1 further cycle of Durvalumab (1500mg) only. Post-surgical resection, adjuvant therapy will consist of Durvalumab Q4W for up to a maximum of 12 months in total or 13 cycles of Durvalumab (11 cycles post op).\\n\\nAll participants will be treated until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent or another discontinuation criterion is met.

Asparaginase is part of the standard of care chemotherapy for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL), and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL). However, in adolescent and young adults (AYA) ages 15-39 years, liver toxicity from asparaginase is common and often prevents delivery of planned chemotherapy, thereby potentially compromising outcomes. Some groups of people may also be at higher risk for liver damage due to the presence of fat in the liver even before starting chemotherapy. Patients who are of Japanese descent, Native Hawaiian, Hispanic or Latinx may be at greater risk for liver damage from chemotherapy for this reason. Carnitine is a naturally occurring nutrient that is part of a typical diet and is also made by the body. Carnitine is necessary for metabolism and its deficiency or absence is associated with liver and other organ damage. Levocarnitine is a drug used to provide extra carnitine. Laboratory and real-world usage of the dietary supplement levocarnitine suggests its potential to prevent or reduce liver toxicity from asparaginase.

Therefore, guidelines recommend surgical resection as the first-line choice for early to mid-stage HCC (CNLC stages IA-IIA or BCLC stages A/B) patients with well liver reserve function. However, the high postoperative recurrence rate is the main factor limiting long-term survival in HCC patients, with literature reporting recurrence rates exceeding 70%. Among these, half of the patients experience recurrence within two years post-surgery, imposing a heavy burden on patients' physical and mental health as well as on societal medical resources. Adopting effective treatment to improve surgical curability and reduce postoperative recurrence rates is one of the current research hotspots.\\n\\nRecent studies from the investigators' center indicate that hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) and immunotherapy can provide definite efficacy for patients with advanced HCC, extending their survival time.

According to GLOBOCAN 2018 data, liver cancer is the sixth most prevalent tumor in the world, with about 841,100 new liver cancer cases and 781,600 deaths per year globally, which is the second leading cause of tumor deaths in men worldwide. China is a high incidence area of liver cancer, accounting for about 50% of the global incidence and deaths.\\n\\nThe treatment of HCC varies according to disease stage, which is based on the BCLC classification system, Child-Pugh liver function rating, and extent of disease. Approximately 30% of HCC cases are diagnosed in the early stages (i.e., BCLC stage 0 or A), and the main treatment options include surgical resection, ablation techniques, and liver transplantation. However, the 5-year recurrence rate remains as high as 70%. The recommended treatment for intermediate stage HCC (i.e., BCLC stage B) is hepatic artery intervention, i.e., transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), but the scope of applicability is limited due to concomitant disease and liver impairment factors, some patients do not derive a survival benefit from it, and patients ultimately progress after treatment and are no longer suitable for further TACE.\\n\\nIn recent years, the multi-drug combination therapy of systemic drugs combined with local therapy has also been gradually adopted, and studies have reported the feasibility of target drugs combined with ICI, TACE or HAIC for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The therapeutic aim of Adebrelimab (SHR-1316) is to inhibit tumor growth by specifically blocking the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and terminating the immunosuppressive signals generated by this receptor on T cells, so that T cells can re-recognize tumor cells and produce killing effects on them.\\n\\nThis study proposes an evaluation to explore the efficacy and safety of irinotecan liposome-based hepatic arterial perfusion chemotherapy (FOLFIRI) in combination with adebrelimab and bevacizumab for the treatment of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'InclusionCriteria': \"\\n\\n1. patients voluntarily enrolled in the study and signed an informed consent form.\\n2. 18-75 years old, both male and female.\\n3. patients with HCC diagnosed histologically, cytologically, or clinically.\\n4.

Despite an improved objective response rate (ORR) of 27%, the majority of patients face HCC progression and liver failure \\\\[Finn et al., N Engl J Med 2020\\\\]. Developing a new combined treatment strategy to overcome resistance to anti-PD-L1 and anti-VEGF is essential to improve patient outcomes.\\n\\nRadiation treatment (RT) is highly efficacious in controlling localized solid tumors and has become an integral component of the treatment algorithm for unresectable HCC. Importantly, a recent retrospective cohort described that RT combined with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was associated with favorable median overall survival of 16.1 months (Manzar et al, Cancers 2022). Our preclinical study (Hsieh et al., Science Immunology 2022) revealed that RT combined with PD-L1/PD-1 blockade induces immunogenic cell death and tumor antigen cross-presentation in antigen-presenting cells, thereby potentiating the systemic antitumor T cell responses in murine tumor models. However, whether the combinatorial therapy with RT, atezolizumab, and bevacizumab can trigger synergistic antitumor effects and systemic immune mobilization has not yet been validated in clinical trials for unresectable HCC.\\n\\nBoth atezolizumab/bevacizumab and X-ray RT are approved treatment methods for unresectable HCC by the U.S. and Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoints combined with targeted therapy is the standard treatment for HCC with abdominal LNM, but the outcome remains very poor, with an objective response rate of 5% to 30%. Previous studies have demonstrated that stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an effective local treatment for HCC with abdominal LNM, with a high response rate of 60% to 80%.

However, many patients are ineligible for these treatments due to advanced disease, social factors, or limited availability of liver donors. Therefore, for patients with unresectable HCC, locoregional therapies like transarterial radioembolization (TARE with Y90) are considered the next best non-operative option, especially when the cancer remains confined to the liver. Despite the use of these liver-directed therapies, relapse rates and mortality remain high, underscoring the need for new predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets, including immune modulation.\\n\\nThe rationale behind NP-101 (TQ formula) stems from its immune modulatory properties as a potent drug derived from a natural substance, black seed or Nigella Sativa. Previous studies have demonstrated its immune modulation and anti-cancer effects, showing promise in preclinical models of HCC. In a randomized phase 2 study conducted in Covid patients, NP-101 exhibited safety and significantly increased T effector cells (CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes), resulting in accelerated recovery. The immune modulation effect of NP-101, observed in the Covid study, and its potential to enhance CD4+ and CD8+ T effector lymphocytes can potentially modify the immune microenvironment and improve outcomes in locally advanced HCC patients undergoing Y90 treatment.\\n\\nThis study will investigate the safety, efficacy and maximum tolerated dose of NP-101 in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.\\n\\nThe dosing scheme for NP-101 in this study will follow a Bayesian Optimal Interval design.

Developing a new combined treatment strategy to overcome resistance to anti-PD-L1 and anti-VEGF is essential to improve patient outcomes.\\n\\nRadiation treatment (RT) is notably effective in managing localized solid tumors and is a fundamental component of unresectable HCC treatment. Recent retrospective cohorts have demonstrated that proton RT targeting all hepatic tumors, along with PD-L1/programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade, enhances ORR and progression-free survival for unresectable HCC patients, displaying a favorable safety profile (Su et al., Am J Cancer Res. 2022). Our preclinical study (Hsieh et al., Sci Immunol 2022) showcased that RT combined with PD-L1/PD-1 blockade stimulates immunogenic cell death and antigen cross-presentation in murine tumor models, promoting systemic antitumor T cell responses.

In Denmark, the incidence of HCC is 5.2 per 100.000 population per year with a dismal prognosis as the median survival time is just 7.7 months.\\n\\nExtrahepatic spread of HCC is common at advanced stages with haematogenous spread to lungs, bones and adrenal glands or lymphatic spread to regional lymph nodes.\\n\\nThe majority of patients who develop HCC have cirrhosis of the liver and in these patients, diagnosis can be made non-invasively with characteristic contrast-enhancement pattern on computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are considered equal in current guidelines, MRI may have a better sensitivity especially for small lesions.\\n\\nPositron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging technique based on the injection of a very small dose of a tracer substance labelled with a positron emitting radioisotope. PET with the glucose tracer 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is an important tool in the staging of many cancer forms, but it is not included in the international guidelines for management of HCC because of suboptimal sensitivity of only up to 50-60 % for HCC situated in the liver.\\n\\nIn Aarhus, the liver specific tracer 18F-FDGal has been developed. It is a fluorine-18 labelled galactose analogue which in the human body is trapped in hepatocytes by phosphorylation by galactokinase. The first study of the diagnostic use of 18F-FDGal PET/CT in patients suspected of having HCC was published in 2011. The study showed good clinical potential for 18F-FDGal as a tracer for detection of intra- as well as extrahepatic HCC.\\n\\nThe aim of the present project is to establish the clinical impact and utilization of 18F-FDGal PET/CT and PET/MRI in patients suspected of having HCC or diagnosed with HCC, for staging and evaluation of treatment response including effect of treatment on liver function.\\n\\nHypotheses:\\n\\nI. Adding 18F-FDGal PET/CT or PET/MRI to diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of or diagnosed with HCC will add to the establishment of a definitive diagnosis and improve staging and thus choice of treatment.\\n\\nII.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of hepatocellular carcinoma patients suffer from advanced unresectable or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Currently targeted therapy alone, or in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist, is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there is growing evidence suggesting that radiation therapy (external or internal) with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors can produce or even augment abscopal effect in which the tumours away from the radiation field also show significant tumour shrinkage. The underlying mechanism of eliciting abscopal effect includes the increased antigen presentation by the myeloid cells within the tumour stroma leading to enhanced tumour cell killing. Previous case reports showed that radiation therapy alone can induce abscopal effect in mice and human models.

Unfortunately, HCC has a morality to incidence ratio that approaches 1.\\n\\nAmong the etiological factors associated with HCC, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are major risk factors. Despite HBV vaccination programs and effective direct antiviral agents (DAA) for treatment of HCV, the incidence of virus-related HCC remains high. HCV eradication by antiviral treatment reduces but does not eliminate HCC risk. Patients with HCV-related cirrhosis require HCC surveillance even after sustained virologic response (SVR) due to a persistent risk of HCC even years after SVR . In Egypt, HCC represents the fourth common cancer and is the most common cause of mortality-related and morbidity-related cancer. Egypt ranks the third and 15th most populous country in Africa and worldwide, respectively, and the Egyptian health authorities consider HCC as one of the most challenging health problems for the current decade. Both HCC screening and monitoring efforts have improved significantly since 2018 as a result of the national screening campaign .The early diagnosis of HCC is essential to initiate curative treatments to improve short term and long-term prognosis. Therefore, highly effective methods are needed to detect HCC at an earlier stage. American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines recommend the periodic use of ultrasound scanning (USS), with or without Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) evaluation, for HCC surveillance. However, suboptimal performance of USS has been reported, with its sensitivity being compromised by the extent of liver cirrhosis, high body mass index (BMI), etiology of liver disease, expertise of the operator and quality of the equipment. Moreover, its sensitivity and specificity for early-stage HCC was found to be rather low . Serum biomarkers play an essential role in diagnosing HCC, as biomarkers are often more convenient, inexpensive, non-invasive, and reproducible . Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a widely used biomarker for HCC diagnosis. The diagnostic accuracy of AFP is limited, however, due to its high false-negative rate to detect small or early stage tumors. As previous studies have demonstrated, the sensitivity of AFP among patients with HCC was 52% for tumors \\\\> 3cm and dropped to only 25% for tumors \\\\< 3cm. In addition, AFP may also be elevated in some benign liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis even in the absence of HCC.', 'InclusionCriteria': '\\n\\n* A total of 90 adult patients with liver cirrhosis attending the outpatient clinic or inpatient section of the department of tropical medicine and gastroenterology at Sohag University Hospital will be included in the study.

Although surgical excision is considered the standard treatment for resectable HCC, a high rate of postoperative recurrence was observed after partial hepatectomy, with a marginal recurrence rate up to 30%. Narrow margin resection may be the most appropriate procedure for centrally located HCC or HCC located near liver capsule because the premise for survival is the conservation of more normal liver parenchyma. Unfortunately, narrow margin resection has been reported to contribute to poor survival outcomes. However, no adjuvant therapy after hepatectomy is generally considered to be effective in reducing post-operative recurrence.\\n\\nRadiotherapy (RT) has been well used in many solid malignant tumors as an (neo)adjuvant to surgical treatment, including HCC. SBRT has shown encouraging rates of local control for HCC. Compared with standard fractionation radiation, SBRT can achieve more precise delivery of high-dose radiation beams to the lesion, obtaining a much smaller target volume. Meanwhile, it could be finished in a short period which can bring more convenience to patients. Recently, several study and randomized controlled trials revealed the survival benefit of adjuvant RT (IMRT and SBRT) in patients with HCC.

In Denmark, the incidence of HCC is 5.2 per 100.000 population per year with a dismal prognosis as the median survival time is just 7.7 month. Extrahepatic spread of HCC is common at advanced stages.\\n\\nThe majority of patients who develop HCC has cirrhosis of the liver and in these patients, diagnosis can be made non-invasively with characteristic contrast-enhancement pattern on CT and/or MRI. Although contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are considered equal in current guidelines, MRI may have a better sensitivity especially for small lesions.\\n\\nPositron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging technique based on the injection of a very small dose of a tracer substance labelled with a positron emitting radioisotope. PET with the glucose tracer 18F-FDG is an important tool in the staging of many cancer forms, but it is not included in the international guidelines for management of HCC because of suboptimal sensitivity of only up to 50-60 % for HCC situated in the liver. Other PET tracers such as 11C- or 18F-choline have also been investigated in patients with HCC with detection rates of 84% in meta-analysis.\\n\\nIn Aarhus, the liver specific tracer 18F-FDGal has been developed. It is a fluorine-18 labelled galactose analogue which in the human body is trapped in hepatocytes by phosphorylation by galactokinase. The first study of the diagnostic use of 18F-FDGal PET/CT in patients suspected for having HCC was published in 2011. The study showed good clinical potential for 18F-FDGal as a tracer for detection of intra- as well as extrahepatic HCC.\\n\\nBoth 18F-choline and 18F-FDGal show potential to improve the detection of extrahepatic disease. Some centres use 18F-choline PET/CT in evaluation of patients with HCC, but the reported results for choline PET/CT do not appear superior to 18F-FDGal PET/CT. Furthermore, 18F-FDGal PET/CT also enables evaluation of regional metabolic liver. A head-to-head study of the two tracers is very much warranted.\\n\\nThe aim of the present project is to establish the clinical impact and utilization of 18F-FDGal PET in concert with state-of-the art radiological methods (CT and MRI) in patients with HCC.\\n\\nHypotheses:\\n\\ni) 18F-FDGal PET performs better than 18F-choline for diagnosis and staging of patients with HCC.\\n\\nii) MRI is expected to perform better than contrast-enhanced CT.', 'InclusionCriteria': '\\n\\n* patients with hepatocellular carcinoma\\n* age above 18 years\\n\\n', 'ExclusionCriteria': '\\n\\n* the patient does not want to take part in the study\\n* the responsible investigator determines that the patient is not qualified for a PET scan\\n* a history of moderate or intense hypersensitivity to a gadolinium-based contrast agent\\n* renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate \\\\[eGFR\\\\] \\\\<30 ml/min/1.73 m2 body surface area\\n* contraindications for MRI including claustrophobia\\n* pregnant or nursing patients.', 'Interventions': {'devices': [], 'drugs': [], 'produce': [], 'behavior': [], 'other': [], 'conbinationproduct': [], 'dietary_supplement': []}}\n",

Therefore, lenvatinib has obvious advantages in HCC treatment because of its strong anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor growth effects.\\n\\nCindilimab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T cells, thereby blocking the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)/programmed death receptor-1 ligand (PD-L1) pathway induced by tumor immune tolerance, and reactivating the antitumor activity of lymphocytes.\\n\\nIn summary, recurrence after radical treatment of liver cancer is an urgent clinical problem.

TACE is a minimally invasive procedure that involves placing a catheter into the artery in the liver that feeds the tumor, administering chemotherapeutics and then blocking the artery with embolics in order to kill tumor cells by depriving them of essential oxygen and nutrients. While TACE has a proven survival benefit, local recurrence is common, and long-term survival rates are poor. Prior studies demonstrate that HCC cells survive the oxygen and nutrient deprivation through autophagy, a process of cellular self-eating, to provide nutrients required for survival.

These clinical studies will serve as proof-of-concept to the study team's translational findings and allow it to uncover predictive biomarkers which will help clinicians to institute more efficacious and personalized treatment in the future. The research team comprises of experts in different complementary fields (epigenomics, genomics, immunomics, metabolomics, proteomics, clinical science and data science) and across different institutions. This allows the team to adopt an integrative approach in understanding the landscape of the HCC tumour micro-environment and biomarkers co-localisation, and their role in tumour evolution and therapeutic response.

Ketamine produces anesthetic and analgesic effects mainly by inhibiting NMDA receptor(N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor), and previous studies have shown that low concentrations of ketamine have obvious analgesic effects. Not only that, ketamine also produces analgesic effects by inhibiting opioid receptors via G-protein coupling. In addition, ketamine can bind to monoaminergic receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system, showing an anticholinergic effect and producing an antispasmodic effect. Ketamine also inhibits inflammatory pain by reducing nitric oxide production by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase. Esketamine is about three to four times more potent than ketamine.

Besides neutralizing infectious HBV virions, Hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIG) can directly bind and neutralize extracellular HBsAg/SVPs, and even intracellular HBsAg targeting is reported. In addition, HBIGs can initiate effector-cell attack (via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, ADCC) towards infected hepatocytes.\\n\\nThe potential benefit of HBIGs in the HCC context is further underlined by recent evidence for the ability of HBIGs to reduce the viability, proliferation, and self-renewal of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) - isolated from HBV-HCC patients - accompanied by downregulation of stemness markers, e.g., OCT-4.According to the current study situation, the use of HBIGs significantly reduces the risk of HBV reinfection after transplantation and improves the results of liver transplantation in patients with chronic HBV infection. The potential benefit of treating HBV-HCC patients on the LTx (liver transplantation) waiting list with hepatitis B immunoglobulin is the possible stop or inhibition of tumor progression while waiting for an LTx. So far there is no clinical evidence of this.\\n\\nMechanistically, hepatitis B immunoglobulin could occur through neutralization of circulating HBsAg, which is an important driver of an immunosuppressive environment in HBV patients, and possibly through direct effects against HBV HCC tumor cells (through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, ADCC). Therefore, the idea behind preoperative HBIG administration before liver transplantation is to reduce the rate of patients in whom a transplantation would no longer have been possible due to tumor progression. Thus, due to tumor progression in HBV-positive HCC-patients there is a monthly drop-out from the waiting list of about 4%.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind the treatment of HBV-HCC patients before tumor resection with hepatitis B immunoglobulin is to potentially stop or positively influence tumor progression through the effects mentioned above, in the time between diagnosis and resection.\\n\\nZhou et al. (2015) have shown a connection between HBsAg levels and HCC relapses after resection, although the exact role of HBsAg is still unclear. In no case will the treatment postpone the time of tumor resection, as only patients are considered who, for clinical reasons, can expect a certain time until resection. The present proof of concept study aims to quantify HBsAg reduction due to preoperative administration of HBIGs in HBV-positive HCC-patients and serve as a template for future multicentre clinical trials.', 'InclusionCriteria': '\\n\\n* Patients ≥ 19 years and ≤ 80 of age\\n* HBsAg-positive HCC-patients scheduled for resection in ≥6 weeks or HBsAg-positive HCC- patients listed for LT\\n* Ability of subjects to understand character and individual consequences of the clinical trial\\n* Written informed consent must be available before enrolment in the trial\\n\\n', 'ExclusionCriteria': '\\n\\n* Clinically significant illness (other than HBV) or any other major medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with subject treatment\\n* No eligibility for resection / LT\\n* Concurrent any other malignancy\\n* Co-infection with hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA positive, HCV RNA-negative/anti-HCV-positive patients can be included) and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\n* Clinical hepatic decompensation\\n* Allergy to HBIG\\n* Pregnant, lactating patients', 'Interventions': {'devices': [], 'drugs': ['Hepatect CP 50 I.E./ml infusion solution'], 'produce': [], 'behavior': [], 'other': [], 'conbinationproduct': [], 'dietary_supplement': []}}\n",
