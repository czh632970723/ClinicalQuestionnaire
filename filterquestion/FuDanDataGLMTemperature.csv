To be eligible for enrollment in the study, participants must meet the following inclusion criteria:

1. Voluntarily provide written informed consent.
2. Age at enrollment is ≥18 years and ≤75 years, both males and females.
3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.
4. Expected survival period of ≥3 months.
5. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Patients who have failed standard treatment (standard treatment includes gemcitabine plus cisplatin plus pembrolizumab, gemcitabine plus gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin, capecitabine plus oxaliplatin, chemotherapy mainly based on albumin-bound paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus platinum-based therapy) or are intolerant to standard treatment, or patients for whom standard treatment is not accessible. Note: Patients who have received adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy targeting non-metastatic disease with curative intent and experience disease progression within ≤6 months after the last treatment are eligible.
6. At least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1 that can be accurately measured repeatedly. Note: Brain metastases cannot be considered as target lesions.
7. Adequate organ function determined by the following requirements:

   1. Hematology (no use of any blood components or growth factors within 7 days prior to starting the study treatment): i. Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L (1,500/mm3). ii. Platelet count ≥ 80 × 109/L (100,000/mm3). iii. Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L.
   2. Kidney:

   i. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × Upper Limit of Normal (ULN). ii. Calculated creatinine clearance\* (CrCl) ≥ 50 mL/min.

   \* CrCl will be calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Cockcroft-Gault formula).

   CrCl (mL/min) = {(140 - age) × body weight (kg) × F} / (SCr (mg/dL) × 72) For males, F = 1; for females, F = 0.85; SCr = serum creatinine. iii. Urine protein ≤ 1+ or 24-hour urinary protein quantification \< 1.0 g. c) Liver: i. Total bilirubin (TBil) ≤ 3 × ULN. ii. AST and ALT ≤ 5 × ULN. iii. Serum albumin (ALB) ≥ 28 g/L. d) Coagulation function: i. International Normalized Ratio (INR) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) ≤ 1.5 × ULN (unless the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy and coagulation parameters \[PT/INR and APTT\] are within the expected range for anticoagulant treatment at screening).

   e) Cardiac function: i. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%.
8. Female participants of childbearing potential must undergo urine or serum pregnancy testing within 3 days prior to the first dose of study medication (if the urine pregnancy test results cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test must be conducted, with the serum pregnancy test result being definitive). If female participants of childbearing potential engage in sexual activity with a nonsterilized male partner, they must use an acceptablemethod of contraception from the start of screening and agree to continue using contraception for up to 120 days after the last dose of the study medication. The decision to stop contraception after this time should be discussed with the investigator.
9. Male participants with a female partner of childbearing potential must use effective contraception from the start of screening until 120 days after the last dose of the study medication. The decision to stop contraception after this time should be discussed with the investigator.
10. Participants must be willing and able to comply with the scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study requirements.

1. Between 18 and 75 years old (including 18 and 75 years old);
2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic (STAGE IIIB-IV) NSCLC does not accept simple sputum smear-based diagnosis;
3. Previous genetic tests confirmed egFR-sensitive mutations, and received one or two generations of EGFR TKI treatment. After drug resistance, it was confirmed to be positive for EGFR T790M mutation by biopsy or free DNA test.
4. The patient has at least one tumor lesion that has not received local treatment such as radiation or biopsy in the screening stage, and can be accurately measured at baseline, with the longest diameter ≥ 10mm at baseline (short diameter ≥ 15mm if lymph nodes are involved).The measurement method chosen is suitable for accurate repeated measurements and can be computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).If there is only one measurable lesion and no previous local treatment such as irradiation, it can be accepted as the target lesion for baseline evaluation of tumor lesions after at least 14 days of diagnostic biopsy.
5. Life expectancy is at least 3 months;
6. ECOG score: 0-1, with no significant clinical deterioration in the past 2 weeks;
7. The main organs function normally, that is, they meet the following standards:

blood routine examination standards must be in accordance with no blood transfusion and adjuvant therapies (14 days) : A. Hemoglobin (HB) ≥90 g/L; B. Absolute value of neutrophils (ANC) ≥1.5×109/L; C. Platelet (PLT) ≥100×109/L; D. Total bilirubin (TBIL) \<1.5 times the upper limit of normal value (ULN); E.

2. Aged between 18 and 80;
3. M1a/b disease with presence of 1-5 visible metastases (detected by bone scan (ECT), chest, abdominal and pelvic CT or MRI). Biopsy of the suspected metastases is recommended to the patients. If the patients refused to the biopsy, additional PSMA-PET/CT or regional MRI should be performed to confirm the metastatic lesions.
4. The metastatic lesions should meet the following the criteria:

   1. Metastases are limited to bone or lymph nodes;
   2. Visceral metastases are not allowed;
   3. Radiographic observed pelvic lymph node metastasis with a diameter of \>2cm should also be considered as one metastatic lesion.
   4. If the lymph nodes are the only detected metastatic lesions, at least one metastatic lymph node should be outside the pelvis.
5. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1;
6. PSA less than 100ng/ml at diagnosis;
7. No more than one month's systemic treatment before enrollment (including castration (surgical or medical castration), castration combined with traditional anti-androgen therapy (flutamide or bicalutamide));
8. No previous pelvic radiotherapy history;
9. The primary lesion of prostate cancer has not received any form of local treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, etc.); TURP is allowed, if the aim of the surgery is to relieve lower urinary tract symptom but not to treat the tumor.
10. The metastatic lesions of prostate cancer have not received any form of local treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, etc.);
11. Written informed consent;
12. Willing and expected to comply with treatment and follow up schedule.

Patient that was diagnosed clinically and genetically as:

* Renal parenchymal aplasia or ectopia, including simple renal aplasia,Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney, kidney tubules dysplasia, and hereditary cystic kidney. ①disease renal agenesis (RA): With ultrasound diagnosis of unilateral renal absence.②Renal hypoplasia (RH)/renal dysplasia (RD) is usually defined as renal volume less than two standard deviations of the average of the same age, or renal total volume less than 50% of the normal value of the same age. RD refers to the presence of undifferentiated or not metaplastic tissue in the kidney, with or without renal volume reduction. Diagnosis is based on the ultrasonic findings of multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) and the diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral renal functional defects by means of isotopic renal functional imaging (DMSA or DTPA);
* Kidney tubular dysplasia: ①the diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease(ADPKD/ARPKD) is mainly dependent on imaging; Patients with a family history of ADPKD can be diagnosed with more than 3 renal cysts on either side. those who with bilateral renal diffuse enlargement with multiple cysts should be clinically considered with PKD even without family history of ADPKD, and relevant gene screening is recommended.②Simple renal cyst: single renal cyst was found by ultrasound or other imaging examination;③Nephronophthisis, NPHP: ultrasonography showed enhanced renal echo or unclear boundary between cortex and medulla, with or without genetic diagnosis or involvement of other system, gene sequence should be considered. Genetic molecular diagnosis is the main diagnostic basis of NPHP diagnosis.④nephrocalcinosis and urinary calculi: the diagnosis depends on the ultrasound diagnosis and the examinations of serum and urine electrolyte and metabolite should be performed to further diagnose the primary disease.
* Abnormalities of Ureter， renal pelvis and/or bladder: ① Dual collection system: Reduplication of kidney or renal pelvis/ureter depends on ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis. ② Urinary obstruction: Including ureteropelvic junction obstruction, ureterovesical junction obstruction or insufficiency. The diagnosis of obstruction depends on magnetic resonance urography (MRU) and isotopic dynamic renal imaging(DTPA) ③ vesicoureteral reflux: The diagnosis depends on voiding cysternography (VCUG).
* Urinary tract anomalies: ① Urethral absence/urethra atresia/ectopic orifice: Diagnosis depends on physical examination and VCUG examination. ② Posterior urethral valve: Severe hydronephrosis can be found by ultrasound, and the diagnosis depends on VCUG examination.

The subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for this study:

1. Patients with histologically confirmed recurrent/metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.
2. Patients who have failed at least one prior standard first- or second-line therapy, including fluoropyrimidine-based therapy, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab. Treatment failure is defined as either radiographic evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity during treatment or within three months following completion of therapy.

   (Note: a. each line of therapy should include at least one or more chemotherapy agents administered for at least one cycle; b. adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy is allowed. If relapse or metastasis occurs during or within six months after completion of adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy, it is considered a failure of first-line chemotherapy for progressive disease. c. For patients with RAS/RAF wild-type tumors, the use of an EGFR inhibitor is not required.)
3. At least one measurable lesion, with the longest diameter ≥10 mm on spiral CT or ≥20 mm on conventional CT (RECIST 1.1 criteria).
4. ECOG performance status of 0-2.
5. Life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.

1. Age ≥ 18 years old, gender unlimited.
2. NSCLC was confirmed by histology or cytology, and it was evaluated as stage IIIB-IV local advanced, recurrent or metastatic patients who could not be treated surgically. Note: ① the diagnosis result of NSCLC based on sputum cytology needs to be confirmed by immunohistochemistry; ② the current disease should be treated by radiotherapy as the first choice The subjects whose treatment strategy or follow-up target focus judged by the researchers should take radiotherapy as the first treatment strategy should not be selected.
3. No systemic anti-tumor therapy was received for locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic NSCLC.
4. According to the method of second-generation sequencing, L858R point mutation in exon 21 of EGFR gene was found in primary NSCLC with or without any other coexisting mutations.
5. Within 28 days before randomization, at least one measurable lesion was selected according to the RECIST v1.1 standard (see Appendix 1); for the lesions that had previously received radiotherapy, only when there was clear disease progression 3 months after the end of radiotherapy, can they be selected as target lesions.
6. ECoG general condition score is 0-1 (see Appendix 2).
7. Expected survival ≥ 12 weeks.
8. Patients receiving radiotherapy can be included in the group if they meet the following conditions:

   There was no history of lung disease radiotherapy within 28 days before randomization; L. for radiotherapy outside the chest area, the interval from the end of final radiotherapy to at least 28 days before randomization, and all toxic reactions have recovered.
9. Good blood function within 14 days before randomization:

L. the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was ≥ 1.5 × 109 / L (without the support of granulocyte colony stimulating factor) and; L lymphocyte count ≥ 0.5 × 109 / L and; 1. Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109 / L and; Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g / dl (in order to reach this standard, patients can receive blood transfusion).

10. Good liver function within 14 days before randomization: L) total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper normal limit (ULN) and;

1. Ast, ALT and ALP of patients without liver metastasis were less than 2.5 × ULN; ast, ALT and ALP of patients with liver metastasis were less than 5 × ULN.

11. Good renal function within 14 days before randomization:

1. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 45 ml / min and; The urine test paper of urine protein was less than 2 +. If the baseline urine analysis of proteinuria patients is ≥ 2 +, 24-hour urine sample collection must be completed, and 24-hour urine protein ≤ 1 g; serum albumin ≥ 25 g / L.

12. Within 14 days before randomization, INR ≤ 1.5 × ULN, APTT ≤ 1.5 × ULN. 13. Heart function meets the requirement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%.

14. Fertile women: during the treatment period and within 6 months after the last administration, they agreed to abstinence (no heterosexual sexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods (contraceptive methods with a failure rate of less than 1%). If a postmenopausal woman has not reached the postmenopausal state (menopausal time ≥ 12 months, no other reason except menopause) and has not undergone sterilization (removal of ovaries and / or uterus), she is defined as a woman with fertility.
