* Have not received radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, molecular targeted therapy, or surgery (except for procedures unrelated to antitumor therapy such as central venous catheterization) within 3 weeks prior to the start of the study, and have recovered from acute toxic effects of previous treatment (if surgery is available, the wound has fully healed).
* No peripheral neuropathy or grade I peripheral neurotoxicity.
* Fertile female subjects are required to use a medically approved contraceptive during study treatment and for at least 3 months after the last use of the study drug; The subjects voluntarily joined the study, signed informed consent, had good compliance, and cooperated with follow-up.

NCT04537364,Prediction of Renal Parenchymal Damage of CAKUT,"

Patient that was diagnosed clinically and genetically as:

* Renal parenchymal aplasia or ectopia, including simple renal aplasia,Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney, kidney tubules dysplasia, and hereditary cystic kidney. ①disease renal agenesis (RA): With ultrasound diagnosis of unilateral renal absence.②Renal hypoplasia (RH)/renal dysplasia (RD) is usually defined as renal volume less than two standard deviations of the average of the same age, or renal total volume less than 50% of the normal value of the same age. RD refers to the presence of undifferentiated or not metaplastic tissue in the kidney, with or without renal volume reduction. Diagnosis is based on the ultrasonic findings of multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) and the diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral renal functional defects by means of isotopic renal functional imaging (DMSA or DTPA);
* Kidney tubular dysplasia: ①the diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease(ADPKD/ARPKD) is mainly dependent on imaging; Patients with a family history of ADPKD can be diagnosed with more than 3 renal cysts on either side. those who with bilateral renal diffuse enlargement with multiple cysts should be clinically considered with PKD even without family history of ADPKD, and relevant gene screening is recommended.②Simple renal cyst: single renal cyst was found by ultrasound or other imaging examination;③Nephronophthisis, NPHP: ultrasonography showed enhanced renal echo or unclear boundary between cortex and medulla, with or without genetic diagnosis or involvement of other system, gene sequence should be considered. Genetic molecular diagnosis is the main diagnostic basis of NPHP diagnosis.④nephrocalcinosis and urinary calculi: the diagnosis depends on the ultrasound diagnosis and the examinations of serum and urine electrolyte and metabolite should be performed to further diagnose the primary disease.
* Abnormalities of Ureter， renal pelvis and/or bladder: ① Dual collection system: Reduplication of kidney or renal pelvis/ureter depends on ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis. ② Urinary obstruction: Including ureteropelvic junction obstruction, ureterovesical junction obstruction or insufficiency. The diagnosis of obstruction depends on magnetic resonance urography (MRU) and isotopic dynamic renal imaging(DTPA) ③ vesicoureteral reflux: The diagnosis depends on voiding cysternography (VCUG).
* Urinary tract anomalies: ① Urethral absence/urethra atresia/ectopic orifice: Diagnosis depends on physical examination and VCUG examination. ② Posterior urethral valve: Severe hydronephrosis can be found by ultrasound, and the diagnosis depends on VCUG examination.
