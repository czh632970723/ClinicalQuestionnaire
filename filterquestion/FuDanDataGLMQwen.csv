RD refers to the presence of undifferentiated or not metaplastic tissue in the kidney, with or without renal volume reduction. Diagnosis is based on the ultrasonic findings of multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) and the diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral renal functional defects by means of isotopic renal functional imaging (DMSA or DTPA);
* Kidney tubular dysplasia: ①the diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease(ADPKD/ARPKD) is mainly dependent on imaging; Patients with a family history of ADPKD can be diagnosed with more than 3 renal cysts on either side. those who with bilateral renal diffuse enlargement with multiple cysts should be clinically considered with PKD even without family history of ADPKD, and relevant gene screening is recommended.②Simple renal cyst: single renal cyst was found by ultrasound or other imaging examination;③Nephronophthisis, NPHP: ultrasonography showed enhanced renal echo or unclear boundary between cortex and medulla, with or without genetic diagnosis or involvement of other system, gene sequence should be considered. Genetic molecular diagnosis is the main diagnostic basis of NPHP diagnosis.④nephrocalcinosis and urinary calculi: the diagnosis depends on the ultrasound diagnosis and the examinations of serum and urine electrolyte and metabolite should be performed to further diagnose the primary disease.
* Abnormalities of Ureter， renal pelvis and/or bladder: ① Dual collection system: Reduplication of kidney or renal pelvis/ureter depends on ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis. ② Urinary obstruction: Including ureteropelvic junction obstruction, ureterovesical junction obstruction or insufficiency.
