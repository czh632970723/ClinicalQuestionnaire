    ],
    "BriefSummary": "Cerebral small vessel disease is a series of clinical, imaging and pathological syndromes caused by various etiologies affecting the arteries, capillaries, venules in the brain. The common causes of cerebral small vessel disease include arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, hereditary cerebral small vessel disease, inflammation-and immune-mediated small vessel disease, venous collagen disease and other small vessel diseases. Of these, age-and hypertension-related cerebral small vessel disease and amyloidosis cerebral small vessel disease are the most common types. The pathophysiological mechanism and clinical manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease are complex. One-fifth of ischemic strokes and the vast majority of nontraumatic parenchymal hemorrhages are due to cerebral small vessel disease. In addition to stroke, patients with cerebral small vessel disease are more often characterized by chronic progressive neurological impairment, which is an important cause of cognitive decline and functional disability in the elderly, and has become one of the important public health problems affecting the quality of life of the elderly.\n\nFocusing on cognitive impairment-related diseases, a large number of clinical studies have shown that Tongxinluo capsule has a dual neurovascular protective effect, which can increase the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and activities of daily living (ADL) score of patients with lacunar cerebral infarction combined with vascular cognitive impairment, reduce fibrinogen (FIB) concentration, improve whole blood viscosity, improve blood viscosity and FIB level, improve activities of daily living and accelerate intellectual recovery in patients with VD; It can also reduce the levels of ET-1 and homocysteine in AD patients, reduce the whole blood viscosity and thus improve the microcirculation in the elderly, increase cerebral blood flow, increase the scores of MMSE and ADL, improve the intelligence of patients, improve memory disorders and language disorders. Meta-analysis of 3458 patients in 40 published clinical literatures of Tongxinluo capsule both domestically and internationally confirmed that Tongxinluo capsule had the effect of promoting the recovery of neurological function, and was safe without adverse reactions.\n\nThis project is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical study to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of Tongxinluo capsule in the treatment of cerebral small vessel disease. A total of 1052 subjects who met the subject screening criteria are planned to be enrolled, with 526 patients in the test group and 526 patients in the placebo group.\n\nThe study is conducted using a central randomization method. For the patients who met the inclusion criteria after examination, they are logged into the Interactive Web Response System by their site, entered the relevant information, and randomized and assigned drugs automatically by the central server according to the ratio of 1:1. Once enrolled, all patients receive the study drug (Tongxinluo or placebo) at 4 capsules/tid for up to 12 months. The study is planned to be conducted at approximately 50 centers across the country using central randomized competing enrollment.",

Diabetic patients with preexisting DME are at increased risk of worsening edema following cataract surgery. Previous studies also reported progression of DR after cataract surgery. Clinically significant DME is now classified into center-involved DME (CI-DME) and non center-involved DME (non-CI DME). Randomized clinical trials have established intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy as first-line treatment for visual impairment from CI-DME and studies have addressed the influence of anti-VEGF therapy among patients with DME undergoing cataract surgery. However, for patients with non-CI DME before cataract surgery, whether anti-VEGF therapy is necessary at the end of surgery to prevent CI-DME is still clinically controversial. In order to evaluate the prophylactic effect of Conbercept (a recombinant fusion protein with high affinity to all VEGF isoforms and PIGF) intravitreal injection at the conclusion of cataract surgery for DME in patients with DR, the investigators will prospectively recruit 40 cataract patients with DR and non-CI DME and randomly assign these subjects into the study group (combined cataract surgery and intravitreal Conbercept injection, 20 cases) and the control group (cataract surgery alone, 20 cases). The primary outcomes include mean changes in central retinal thickness (CRT) and in diabetic retinopathy severity score (DRSS).

    "BriefSummary": "Radiotherapy plays an important role in multidisciplinary treatment of esophageal cancer. Data from many laboratories indicate that local radiation produces systemic, immune-mediated anti¬tumour and, potentially, antimetastatic effects. Additionally, the combination of local radiotherapy and immune-modulation can augment local tumour control and cause distant (abscopal) antitumour effects through increased tumour-antigen release and antigen-presenting cell (APC) cross-presentation, improved dendritic-cell (DC) function, and enhanced T cell priming. The generation of an effective antitumor immune response requires the presentation of tumor antigens to naïve CD8+ cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN) . Tumor-draining lymph nodes, however, are often subject to the immunosuppressive activity of tumor-derived factors, such as cytokines and other bioactive molecules from tumor cells and their associated leukocytes in the primary tumor site that contribute to the overriding of effective rejection mechanisms. Thus, in TDLN a T cell tolerance rather than a T cell activation often occurs, thereby preventing immune attack and facilitating local tumor progression.",

Colorectal tumors have high glucose consumption, which makes tumor cells very sensitive to changes in nutritional metabolism of the surrounding environment (such as diet restriction / fasting). Previous studies have shown that cyclic FMDs are safe and feasible for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy alone.

With a rising cases of complex CHD and patients with pulmonary valve regurgitation in TOF repair, a further demand is underway for valved conduits. Meanwhile, common biological valved conduits applied in foreign countries are not approved in China yet, with high failure and reintervention, reducing the long-term survival. Our team manufactured a novel valved conduit with 0.1mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and gore-tex conduit. This ePTFE valved conduit played a satisfying role in anti-regurgitation and failure rate through in vitro fluid test and animal experiments. Besides, our team manufactured templates for the conduit and also simplified the suturing process so that the repeatability of suturing valved had been risen. Until now, over 70 cases have been implanted with this ePTFE valved conduit with positive early and mid-term follow-up results.\n\nDespite the progress which have been made, there still remain some problems to solve. First, systematic prospective randomized comparative study will be performed. Second, this is just a single-center study. Third, these patients should have longer follow-up time to evaluate the ePTFE conduit long-term effect. Finally, imaging data are blank for evaluating the function of the conduit and right ventricle. In this prospective comparative research, the new designed ePTFE valved conduit and bovine jugular vein valved conduits are conducted as a randomized controlled trail. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is used to precisely evaluate the anti-regurgitation effect of the valved conduit and the right ventricle function. Investigators can further access the application of this newly designed ePTFE valved conduit. Investigators aim to provide a self-manufactured, low failure rate valved conduit.",

    "BriefSummary": "More and more studies have shown that the efficacy and prognosis of HPV （Human papillomavirus）-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) patients are better than those of others. However, in the NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) Oncology Clinical Guidelines for OPC treatment, each group of p16+ is consistent with the corresponding group of p16-, which indicates that the treatment of OPC is basically the same regardless of whether it is related to HPV. Several studies attempted to reduce the toxicities of treatment of HPV related OPC through reduced-dose radiation and showed promising results, and all of the studies have shown that induction chemotherapy is a good way to screen followed treatment. Those who are effective in induction chemotherapy are usually more sensitive to radiation therapy, and reducing the intensity of subsequent treatment will not affect the survival outcome of patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have proved to improve outcomes of head and neck cancers. However, In KEYMAT-048, a Phase III controlled trial of relapsed/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, ICIs showed an overall survival advantage, but the survival advantage was independent of HPV status. Therefore, patients with HPV-negative OPC still have a good response to ICIs. So we added anti-PD-1 antibody Toripalimab to induction chemotherapy in order to achieve better response rates to receive de-escalation chemoradiotherapy followed regardless of whether it is related to HPV.",

    "BriefSummary": "In the global landscape of cancer, head and neck malignancies are highly prevalent, with 878,000 new cases and 444,000 deaths recorded in 2020. Notably, laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers contribute to around 30% of these instances. More than 50% of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced disease, necessitating intensive treatments that significantly impact their quality of life. Despite these efforts, the prognosis for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers remains grim, with a 5-year survival rate of 30% to 50%.\n\nPast approaches focused on preserving laryngeal function and patient well-being, including minimally invasive surgery, advanced radiotherapy, and induction chemotherapy. Our prior research highlighted the effectiveness of combining toripalimab-based induction therapy and chemotherapy, followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy or surgery. Positive short-term outcomes and manageable side effects were observed, with encouraging larynx preservation rates after one year.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the current study aims to explore neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer. It seeks to compare the therapeutic efficacy and quality of life impacts of concurrent radiochemotherapy and organ-preserving surgery. The ultimate goal is to identify optimal strategies for future interventions.",

    "BriefSummary": "Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and others, that begin at a developmental stage and severely affect the growth and development of the brain. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a group of neurodevelopmental syndromes characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication as well as repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. There is strong evidence for the involvement of inherited genetic factors in ASD (accounting for at least 80% of the variation in disease risk). There is strong evidence for the involvement of inherited genetic factors in ASD (accounting for at least 80% of the variation in disease risk). According to a meta-analysis, monogenic mutations in SHANK3, which encodes the major postsynaptic density (PSD) scaffolding protein at excitatory glutamatergic synapses, are found in approximately 0.69% of ASD cases and up to 2.12% of all moderate to profound intellectual disability cases. De novo mutations, interstitial deletions, and terminal deletions have been identified in ASD.\n\nRecent studies have shown that children with ASD have significantly lower levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) than those without. Studies have shown that higher DHA intake reduces the risk of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety disorder, and conduct disorders. After DHA treatment, most children with ASD showed clinical and biochemical improvements, with increased DHA levels as measured by blood analysis and significant improvements in social scale scores in the supplement group. Moreover, increasing DHA levels in children with ADHD through dietary supplements can improve behavior, attention, literacy, cognitive problems, and working memory function. Therefore, for neurodevelopmental disorders, high DHA intake may be an important component of disease prevention.",

Patients who receive treatment in the early stage (stage I) have a 5-year survival rate of approximately 90%. However, for high-risk stage II and III colorectal cancer patients, the 5-year survival rate is only 40%-70%, and almost half of the patients experience postoperative recurrence and metastasis.\n\nCirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a small fraction of total cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in peripheral blood circulation, carrying tumor-specific genetic and epigenetic information. It can usually be detected in the serum or plasma of tumor patients in peripheral blood. Studies have shown that methylation detection of plasma ctDNA can be used for predicting the efficacy and prognosis of tumor postoperatively, as well as for dynamic monitoring.\n\nCurrent methods for monitoring CRC recurrence include testing for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in blood and periodic computed tomography (CT) scans. However, due to the low sensitivity of CEA and the radiation and cost limitations of CT examination, the disease status of postoperative CRC patients cannot be well-monitored.\n\nctDNA is a promising biomarker for monitoring the recurrence and metastasis of CRC. Research results have shown that ctDNA can be detected in nearly all subjects before surgery, and the changes in ctDNA levels are related to the extent of surgical resection. The detection of ctDNA after surgery generally indicates recurrence within one year. ctDNA may be a more reliable and sensitive indicator than the current standard biomarker CEA, providing a window for early intervention.\n\nThis multicenter, prospective, and randomized controlled cohort study uses a single-tube methylation-specific quantitative PCR (mqMSP) detection, which detects 10 different methylation markers and can quantitatively analyze plasma samples containing tumor DNA as low as 0.05%. This study will use the ctDNA methylation detection technology to conduct quantitative detection of ctDNA methylation in the plasma of enrolled patients, hoping to predict the recurrence and metastasis risk of patients at an earlier stage through ctDNA changes, and to explore the value of ctDNA detection in guiding postoperative follow-up for non-metastatic CRC.",

Any crisis in confidence has the potential to cause significant disruption and a detrimental impact on vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy is a complex and context-specific issue that varies across time, place, and vaccines. It has been cited by World Health Organization(WHO) as one of the top ten threats to global health in 2019. Coronavirus disease(COVID-19) pandemic may change public confidence in vaccines. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a surveillance system to monitor vaccine confidence and hesitancy in real time.\n\nTo date, a growing body of literature has used social media platforms such as Twitter and weico for public health research. Large amounts of real time data posted on social media platforms can be used to quickly identify the public's attitudes on vaccines, as a way to support health communication and health promotion, messaging. However, textual data on social media is difficult to be analyzed. Recent progress in machine learning makes it possible to automatically analyze textual data on social media in real time.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will establish a social media surveillance and analysis platform on vaccines, develop a series of machine learning models to monitor vaccine confidence and early detect emerging vaccine-related risks, and assess public communication around vaccines. The investigators will assess the temporal and spatial distribution of vaccine confidence and hesitancy globally using Twitter data and in China using weico data, for all vaccines and Human Papilloma Virus(HPV) vaccine, respectively. Our study will guide the design of effective health communication strategies to improve vaccine confidence.",

While with unique pathophysiology among newborn infants, neonatal ECLS treatment faces different challenges (such as specific indications, anticoagulation, hemodynamic management, high incidences of complications, ect.) from those of elder children or adults. Though neonatal ECMO has been used in developed countries since 1970s, the introduction of neonatal ECMO in China was not reported until 2010s. While on the other hand, there has been a rapid increase of neonatal ECLS cases and centers in China in the past decade with a huge variation of numbers of cases and quality among different centers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to monitor the use and quality of neonatal ECLS in China. The goal of the Chinese Neonatal Extracorporeal Life Support Registry (Chi-NELS) is to maintain a registry of use of ECLS in active neonatal ECLS centers across China, to support quality improvement of neonatal ELCS, clinical research and regulatory agencies.",

    "BriefSummary": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is biologically different from traditional head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The mainstay treatment for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma is cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation. Recent phase III randomized control trials have demonstrated that induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiation further improved progression-free survival.\n\nHowever, not every patient has good response to induction chemotherapy. Evidence has accumulated that those with poor response to induction chemotherapy, or those with detectable Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA post induction chemotherapy, correlated with poorer progression-free survival. Huang CL et al. (Int J Radiat Oncol Bio Phys. 2019) reported that plasma EBV DNA load at completion of induction chemotherapy was an independent and earlier predictor for progression-free survival and overall survival in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Lv J et al. (Nat Commun. 2019) demonstrated that real-time monitoring of plasma EBV DNA response added prognostic information, and had the potential uitility for risk-adapted treatment intensification in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\n\nTherefore, investigators selects those with poor plasma EBV DNA response during and after induction chemotherapy, and intensifies the treatment with combination of anti-PD-1 antibody, in order to improve progression-free survival in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, according to response-adapted strategy.",

    "BriefSummary": "The prognosis of patients with metastatic right-sided colon cancer is worse than that of patients with metastatic left-sided cancer. Different guidelines have different recommendations on specific conversion therapy for colorectal liver metastases. The United States NCCN guidelines do not recommend standard chemotherapy combined with anti EGFR monoclonal antibody for patients with right colon cancer. The European ESMO guidelines recommend that patients with Ras / BRAF wild-type right-sided colon cancer should first consider three drugs ± bevacizumab, but considering the objective response rate results, standard chemotherapy + anti EGFR monoclonal antibody is still one of the choices. China CSCO guidelines recommend standard chemotherapy ± bevacizumab, and also recommend standard chemotherapy + cetuximab for patients with right-sided colon cancer.\n\nTherefore, the targeted therapy for RAS / BRAF wild-type metastatic right colon cancer is still controversial. Therefore, we are ready to carry out the clinical trial of cetuximab and bevacizumab in conversion therapy for RAS / BRAF wild-type metastatic right colon cancer. The conversion resection rate is the primary point, and the objective response rate, perioperative safety and long-term survival are the secondary points.",

Sepsis is a complex process that ultimately leads to circulation disorders, organ perfusion abnormalities, capillary leakage, tissue hypoxia, and organ failure. The difficulty of clinical treatment is microcirculation and mitochondrial dysfunction in septic shock. Once shock enters the stage of microcirculation failure, conventional treatment is ineffective. ECMO can effectively support the circulatory system and provide good oxygen delivery, but there are many controversies in clinical treatment. 1) whether ECMO can effectively improve the clinical prognosis of children with septic shock; 2) appropriate timing for ECMO intervention; 3) which key clinical factors affect the effect of ECMO treatment. This study intends to adopt a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized controlled trial design, and the main research hypothesis is whether ECMO treatment can improve the success of discharge survival of children with septic shock.",

Several studies attempted to reduce the toxicities of treatments through reduced-dose radiation and showed promising results, but all data were collected from non-Chinese areas. Like nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), oropharyngeal carcinoma may have different biological behavior and relationship with HPV infection. So the investigators studied whether toxicities reducing treatment with reduced radiation dose and omitted concurrent chemotherapy after good response to induction chemotherapy would maintain survival outcomes while improving tolerability for patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have proved to improve outcomes of head and neck cancers including EBV-related NPC. Oropharyngeal carcinoma was considered to be similar with NPC in terms of immune environment. So we added anti-PD-1 antibody Toripalimab to induction chemotherapy in order to achieve better response rates to receive de-escalation chemoradiotherapy followed.",

    "BriefSummary": "Emergence agitation is the most common reason for post-anesthesia care unit delay. Sevoflurane is used frequently inhalational anaesthetic agent to provide pediatric anaesthesia because of the nonirritant nature. It has been successfully used for keeping spontaneous breathing without tracheal intubation. However, sevoflurane may cause emergence agitation as the incidence varied from 10%-80%. Although there are many sedative agents to reduce its incidence, such as propofol, midazolam, a2 adrenergic receptor agonists and ketamine, the efficacy remains limited.\n\nKetamine, a neuroleptic anesthetic agent, contains two optical isomers, s(+)-ketamine (esketamine) and R(-)-ketamine. Esketamine is a right-handed split of ketamine, which has enhanced analgesic potency and lower incidence of psychotropic side effects compared to ketamine. It stimulate breathing due to N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor blockade, and could even effectively countered remifentanil-induced respiratory depression. The investigators compared the effectiveness of esketamine and sevoflurane in reducing the incidence of emergence agitation after painless ophthalmological procedure in pediatric patients.",

    "BriefSummary": "The particularity of adenoids, as a reservoir of bacterial pathogens and immune molecules, is known to be significantly involved in children with otitis media with effusion (OME). As an important carrier of intercellular substance transfer and signal transduction, exosomes with different biological functions can be secreted by different types of cells. There remains significant uncertainty regarding the clinical transmitter of exosomes to OME, especially in its pathophysiologic development. In this study, the investigators try to elucidate the biological functions of exosomes in children with adenoid hypertrophy accompanied by OME.\n\nPatients with adenoid hypertrophy or otitis media will be separated into three groups: those with adenoid hypertrophy, with otitis media and with adenoid hypertrophy and otitis media both, as well as a healthy control group. Participants in the four groups will have their middle ear effusion, nasopharyngeal secretion, and peripheral blood samples taken, from which exosomes will be separated for further analysis. Adenoidectomy will be conducted in adenoid hypertrophy accompanied by OME and adenoid hypertrophy alone and their adenoid tissue will be collected. Blood will be collected again 3 months after surgery and middle ear and nasopharyngeal examinations will be performed. Exosomes will be isolated for follow-up studies as before surgery. Investigators will also use proteome research, exosome biomarkers, and high-throughput sequencing to examine the pathophysiology of OME, particularly inflammation-related etiology, in order to provide novel ideas for OME diagnosis and treatment.",

Most colorectal cancer develops from colorectal adenoma and is a disease that can be prevented and controlled. Thanks to early screening, the incidence rate and mortality of colorectal cancer have declined year by year. However, due to poor compliance with colonoscopy and the lack of efficient and convenient early screening methods, it is difficult to screen for colorectal cancer in China. According to the data from Shanghai Xuhui District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the proportion of colonoscopies in high-risk groups for colorectal cancer is less than 18%.\n\nThis project plans to use the latest colorectal cancer screening technology, namely, 5hmC detection in peripheral blood and DNA methylation detection in feces, for those who are positive in the colorectal cancer incidence risk questionnaire or fecal occult blood in Xuhui District, Shanghai. It is strongly recommended that subjects with positive screening should undergo colonoscopy, to effectively improve the rate of colonoscopy and the early diagnosis rate of colorectal cancer. At the same time, to explore the screening efficiency of the early diagnosis model of 5hmC cancer.",

    "BriefSummary": "Locally advanced breast cancer has high-risk local regional recurrence after surgery. Radiotherapy could reduce the local regional recurrence and improve disease free survival and overall survival. Regional lymph node irradiation is the important part of breast cancer radiotherapy. However, there are some controversies about regional lymph node delineation, especially the supraclavicular irradiation volume. Many studies had confirmed that posterolateral region of the supraclavicular fossa (also named Posterior neck lymph node) had a high risk involvement based on the mapping of recurrence nodes. This randomized phase III trial compares medial supraclavicular lymph node irradiation with entire supraclavicular lymph node irradiation in patients with pathologically positive axillary lymph node and high risk of recurrence after mastectomy or breast conservative surgery. It is not yet known if radiation works better with entire supraclavicular fossa than medial supraclavicular fossa.",

PCLE will be used in surgery to identify tumor is malignant or not, and surgeons will decide procedures of surgery based on outcomes of PCLE. In this present study, clinical trials will be divided into two phases. In the first phase, based on the definitive postoperative pathologic diagnosis, characteristic imaging structures that were collected by PCLE will be identified and primary diagnostic imaging criteria for pancreatic cancer would be developed. In the second phase, this criterion will be used for rapid intraoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and predicting status of resection margin. In addition, accuracy of PCLE will be verified based on postoperative pathologic reports.",

    "BriefSummary": "A number of anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies have been approved for the treatment of various advanced tumors in the world, and many studies on anti-PD-1 /L1 monoclonal antibodies for breast cancer are also being carried out. HX008 (Taizhou Hanzhong Biomedical Co., Ltd.China) combined gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP) regimen for first-line treatment of advanced triple negative breast cancer has been shown good efficacy. On the other hand,HRD as the target of PARP inhibitor therapy in the treatment of breast cancer has a broad prospect, In HRD tumor patients, the use of PARPi can make obstacles of DNA damage repair(DDR), accumulation of DNA damage, thus promote the apoptosis of tumor cells. Several PARPi have been approved worldwide (including Olaparib, Rucaparib, Niraparib, Talazoparib, Veliparib) for the treatment of ovarian and/or breast cancer. Theoretically, PARPi and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody can play a synergistic mechanism. In this study, HX008 combined with Niraparib is designed to treat metastatic breast cancer patients with DDR gene (BRCA1/2, PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, ATR, BAP1, BARD1, BLM, BRIP1, CHEK1, CDK12, FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCM, MRE11A, NBN, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, WRN) pathogenic/suspected pathogenic germline mutation, so as to explore the possibility of more combined therapy for breast cancer to achieve better therapeutic effect.",

    "BriefSummary": "At present, the clinical studies of 5-HT3RA are aimed at nausea and vomiting induced by single-day chemotherapy, but there are many chemotherapy schemes that require multi-day administration in clinical practice. Compared with single-day chemotherapy, multi-day chemotherapy (including multi-day intravenous chemotherapy and multi-day administration of oral antineoplastic drugs) faces a more complex situation, requiring the prevention of both acute CINV, and delayed CINV at the same time. Clinically, oral or intravenous 5-HT3 antagonists are needed for many times, and the convenience is poor. Especially with the increasing application of oral antineoplastic drugs (including oral chemotherapeutic drugs and oral molecular targeted drugs), the nausea and vomiting caused by oral antineoplastic drugs have attracted more and more attention of clinicians. Pyrotinib is an oral, irreversible pan-ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with activity against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/HER1, HER2, and HER4.12 Preclinical data suggest that pyrotinib can irreversibly inhibit multiple ErbB receptors and effectively inhibit the proliferation of HER2-overexpressing cells both in vivo and in vitro. Pirotinib is an effective drug that progresses after treatment with trastuzumab. At present, pirrotinib combined with capecitabine has made a major breakthrough in the treatment of recurrent and metastatic HER-positive breast cancer, with a median PFS of 18.1 months and an ORR of 78.5%. Although most adverse reactions are controllable, the program The incidence of related nausea and vomiting has reached about 50%, and nausea and vomiting most often occurred in the first week after treatment, which not only affected the patient's quality of life, but also affected the treatment compliance of the two oral drugs to a certain extent. It has become a more difficult problem for clinicians in the treatment process.",

Although sevoflurane has been used for pediatric anesthesia with successful keep spontaneous breathing without intubation, it should be noted that sevoflurane often results in air pollution under the open airway background and postoperative agitation.\n\nEsketamine is the S (+) isomer of ketamine, which produces a dissociated state with minimal risk of airway compromise or apnea. It has enhanced analgesic potency and faster elimination compared to ketamine. However, it may also cause delirium during the recovery time.

    "BriefSummary": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radical cystectomy is the standard if care for cisplatin-eligible patients with MIBC. Developments in the last two decades suggest that bladder sparing therapy may be a valuable alternative to radical cystectomy. Currently, well-documented TMT regimens, which include complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, demonstrated durable oncologic control and long-term survival in selected patients. Nevertheless, TMT has not been widely used in clinical practice. On the one hand, due to the complexity of TMT, multiple clinical departments are required to cooperate in the assessment, treatment and follow-up of patients. On the other hand, concerns about tumor recurrence, lack of surgical intervention in regional lymph nodes, and organ dysfunction due to the treatment of large doses of pelvic radiation have reduced the clinical acceptance of TMT. In recent years, immunocheckpoint inhibitors such as PD-1/L1, including Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Tislelizumab, have proven to be promising immunotherapy approaches for advanced urothelium cancer, leading to breakthroughs in the treatment of advanced urothelium cancer. Immunocheckpoint inhibitors also showed positive efficacy in patients who did not respond to BCG treatment during perioperative period. Therefore, immunotherapy can be another means of bladder preservation after surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, bladder sparing target population is still unclear, among which, the NCCN guidelines recommend patients suitable for bladder preservation: T2-3N0M0, single lesion (longest diameter less than 6 cm), histological type of urothelial carcinoma, no CIS, and no hydronephrosis. Therefore, the focus of bladder preservation treatment is not only on the treatment before and during bladder preservation, but also on maximizing the follow-up treatment of TURBT and exploring its long-term benefits based on response to systematic treatment before maximized TURBT.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of intercostal nerve block (ICNB) and paravertebral block(PV) for preventing postoperative pain after rib cartilage graft for auricular reconstruction in children with microtia.\n\nMethods: In this prospective randomized study, 144 children will be enrolled in this study and randomized into 3 groups:48 patients will received ultrasound-guided ICNB(UG-ICNB group);48 patients will receive ICNB under direct vision (DV-ICNB group) and 48 patients will receive paravertebral block(PV group) undergoing postoperative pain control using either preventive ICNB followed by catheter-based infusion (33 patients, study group) or intravenous (IV) analgesia alone (33 patients, control group). ICNB will be performed by injecting 1% lidocaine plus 1/200000 epinephrine 3ml into each of three intercostal spaces before perichondrial dissection. PV will be carried out by injecting 1% lidocaine plus 1/200000 epinephrine 9ml into T7 paravertebral space just after induction of anesthesia.before wound closure.Each patient receive patient-controlled intravenous analgesia(PCIA) after surgery.Severity of pain,nausea,vomiting and other side effects would be assessed for the postoperative period of 48 hours.",

    "BriefSummary": "Approximately 5% to 10% of gastric cancers have MSI-H/dMMR. According to the results of retrospective analysis of CLASSIC and MAGIC, MSI-H/dMMR was a good prognosis and potential negative predictor of adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable gastric cancer. GC patients with MSI-H/dMMR were relatively insensitive to chemotherapy. The prognosis of these patients receiving routine postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was worse than that with surgery alone. However, these patients were sensitive to immunotherapy. MSI-H/dMMR is one of the most important biomarkers to predict the efficacy of immunotherapy for GC. In this study, patients with MSI-H locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma after radical surgery with D2 dissection would be randomly treated with conventional adjuvant chemotherapy, PD-1 monoclonal antibody immunotherapy or follow-up observation. We intend to demonstrate that the prognosis of MSI-H GC patients after D2 radical gastrectomy receiving PD-1 monoclonal antibody immunotherapy would be better than that with standard postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and follow-up observation.",

    "BriefSummary": "Histology transformation from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC), especially from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), is widely recognized as a rare mechanism for NSCLC to confer tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resistance. The probability of its occurrence is about 3-14% in NSCLC patients who are resistant to TKI treatment. In addition to EGFR mutations, NSCLC patients carrying ALK/ROS1 mutations and receiving corresponding TKI treatment may also experience NEC transformation(NET).\n\nIn a previous study \\[Pubmed ID: 35609408\\], the investigators demonstrated that NET also develops in NSCLCs without TKI targets or treatments. This phenomenon could be under-recognized, because re-biopsy was less frequently performed in these patients. The investigators had also shown that p53/Rb inactivation might correlated with NET and should be considered for NET risk prediction. In another retrospective studies, it was found that NSCLC patients with RB1/TP53 dual inactivation mutations had a significantly higher probability of NEC pathological transformation than those without RB1/TP53 inactivation mutations (43 times higher than those without mutations). Therefore, the subgroup of NSCLC patients with tumor suppressor gene RB1/TP53 dual inactivation might have elevated risk for NET.\n\nIn this study, the investigators proposed to prospectively follow up NSCLC patients with dual RB1/TP53 inactivation (approximately 5% of the total NSCLC). Through prospective and systematic collection of baseline pathological information, clinical treatment process, and imaging data, and as much as possible, repeat pathological biopsies will be performed during disease progression.",

    "BriefSummary": "Because nasopharyngeal carcinoma （NPC）is very sensitive to radiation and the specificity of the anatomical structure, radiotherapy has become the core treatment for NPC. Although induction chemotherapy combined with cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy can effectively improve the overall survival and progression-free survival of NPC, such a sequential pattern can further exacerbate the toxic side effects of treatment, such as mucosal reactions and gastrointestinal toxicity. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore another treatment mode with high efficiency and low toxicity. Secondly, patients with poor response after induction chemotherapy indicate chemotherapy resistance. Whether patients can still benefit from concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy in the followed radiotherapy is doubtful. PD-1 inhibitor and anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody have proved to improve outcomes of head and neck cancers including EBV-related NPC, which have also showed relatively low toxicity. In this study, radiotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitor and anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody were applied to treat patients with locally advanced NPC who were resistant to induction chemotherapy.",

    "BriefSummary": "In 2018, colorectal cancer is the third most common malignant tumor in terms of morbidity and second mortality in the world. Surgical resection is still the main treatment for colorectal cancer.With the introduction of the ERAS, the latest international and domestic guidelines for fasting before surgery all advocate shortening the fasting time. For example, 2 hours before surgery, oral take cleared fluids, including water, sugar water, fruit juice, tea and black coffee (without milk) is allowed.Solid food can be consumed 4 hours before surgery, and oral diet should be resumed as soon as possible after surgery. Changes in diet, nutritional status, and physical activity are closely related to the incidence of colorectal cancer. Therefore, we believe that the intestine may be very sensitive to different fasting times during the perioperative period. Prolonging the fasting time may improve the prognosis by improving postoperative insulin resistance, reducing inflammation and protecting anti-tumor immune function in patients with colorectal cancer.Prolonged fasting time seems to be contrary to the results of some studies, and whether it is applicable to patients with tumor surgery is unclear. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct large-scale, prospective, randomized controlled clinical studies to clarify the most suitable perioperative fasting strategy (including composition, interval, and amount) for cancer patients, which can not only reduce surgical stress and speed up postoperative rehabilitation,reduce postoperative metastasis and recurrence and improve mid- and long-term prognosis.",

    "BriefSummary": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a global health issue adversely impacting the quality of life (QoL) of affected individuals and exerting a huge public health burden. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of not only the symptoms, but also the underlying causes of the disease. Moreover, AIT has a preventative role against new sensitizations and development of asthma in AR patients. Hence AIT is recommended as an integrated part of an allergy management strategy in the treatment of AR. Over the development of one century, AIT has been delivered by various routes. Among them, subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) has been currently widely used in clinical practice.\n\nHouse dust mite (HDM) has been reported to be the most common sensitizing allergen in China. Nasal obstruction is the common complaint in HDM-sensitized AR and prompts patients to seek medical help. It has been proved that HDM-SCIT showed favourable efficacy in treating persistent AR. However, HDM-SCIT recommends 3 years of subcutaneous injection and requires good adherence to guarantee the efficacy. Later onset of nasal obstruction alleviation might reduce the adherence of HDM-SCIT.\n\nRadiofrequency ablation of bilateral inferior turbinate can relieve nasal obstruction within a short time after operation. It is hypothesized that, in HDM-AR patients with severe nasal obstruction, bilateral inferior turbinate surgery followed by HDM-SCIT will obtain quick-onset of good nasal ventilation and improve AIT adherence.\n\nThe overall objective of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to test whether radiofrequency ablation of bilateral inferior turbinate followed by subcutaneous immunotherapy will improve nasal obstruction among patients with house dust mite sensitized allergic rhinitis (HDM-AR) compared to subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) only during the 4-month build-up phase as well as the 36-month full phase of SCIT.",

Countries have different definitions of rare diseases. The definition of rare diseases in China is defined as: diseases with a prevalence of less than 1 in 500 000 or newborns with an incidence of less than 1/10 000 are rare diseases. Due to the low incidence of rare diseases and the accumulation of multiple organs and systems in most diseases, clinicians lack comprehensive and systematic understanding. Patients often face great difficulties in seeking medical treatment and diagnosis. Currently, there is a lack of systematic and rare diseases in China. Management, diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, making the diagnosis of rare diseases, prevention interventions seriously lagging behind, obviously behind the management of developed countries and regions; rare diseases are mostly related to genetic variation, with the clinical application of genetic diagnosis technology, more and more Many genetically related rare diseases have been diagnosed at an early stage; at present, precision medicine is rapidly developing, and more and more rare disease clinical trials have entered the country, bringing prospects for the treatment of rare diseases. For this reason, the management of rare diseases is particularly important.\n\nAt present, some rare diseases of the nervous system can be treated early; for example, immune-related rare diseases have common normative immunotherapy and functional disability prevention, and the characteristics of single disease management of each disease; hereditary degenerative rare diseases such as progressive 2-3 multi-center clinical trials of spinal muscular atrophy and progressive muscular dystrophy have been entered into our hospital (in our hospital), X-linked pre-diagnosis of adrenal malnutrition genetic diseases, and appropriate treatment time is selected. Stem cell transplantation is in research and planning; the long-term management and comprehensive treatment of nodular sclerosis and Dravet syndrome are important for the prevention and treatment of diseases; therefore, the early diagnosis, pathogenesis and standardized treatment of rare diseases of the nervous system are urgent.

    "BriefSummary": "Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) refers to a group of malignant tumors derived from non-epithelial extraosseous tissues, mainly from the mesoderm, partly from the neuroectoderm, including muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels and peripheral nerves . STS is divided into 12 major categories based on tissue origin. According to different morphologies and biological behaviors, there are more than 50 subtypes. The most common subtypes include: undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), liposarcoma (LPS), leiomyosarcoma (LMS), synovial sarcoma ( SS). The most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents is rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Soft tissue sarcoma is a group of highly heterogeneous tumors, which are characterized by local invasiveness, invasive or destructive growth, local recurrence and distant metastasis.\n\nThe pathological features of STS that occur in the nasal cavity and sinuses are similar to other parts of the body. However, because it can affect important structures such as the orbit, optic nerve, skull base bone, dura mater, cranial nerve and even brain tissue, the diseased site is deep, the anatomical structure is complex, the treatment is difficult, the range of surgical resection is limited, and the surgical margin Negative is difficult to guarantee, and related treatments may have obvious complications, which affect the survival and prognosis of patients.\n\nSurgical treatment is the most important and most likely effective treatment for STS. With the development of endoscopic skull base anatomy and surgical techniques, the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic sinus surgery for the treatment of nasal cavity and sinus tumors have been fully confirmed, and it has become the main surgical method for nasal cavity and sinus STS. This is also the theoretical and practical basis for the feasibility of this research.\n\nThe study intends to conduct a single-arm, prospective, observational study of endoscopic sinus surgery for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses to explore the therapeutic effect and complications of endoscopic surgery for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, and explore its relationship with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

With the improvement of treatment methods, some breast cancer patients have experienced different degrees of financial toxicity, which seriously affected the quality of life, treatment compliance and treatment outcomes of patients. Currently, there are some related studies on financial toxicity in breast cancer patients, but they are mainly cross-sectional studies, lacking the use of validated financial toxicity tools to measure the longitudinal change trajectory of financial toxicity. The financial toxicity of breast cancer patients may change dynamically with the treatment stage, expenditure and time, so it is necessary to conduct a rigorously designed prospective study to explore the trajectory of financial toxicity. In addition, previous studies have showed that financial toxicity may be associated with anxiety, distress, pain and overall symptom burden. However, the relevant evidence is currently limited. This study is designed as a prospective longitudinal study to explore the trajectory of financial toxicity and its influencing factors in breast cancer patients in China, and to focus on the relationship between symptom burden and financial toxicity, which will help clinicians identify potential high-risk populations, and provide a new perspective for future intervention programs.",

    "BriefSummary": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal tumors. According to the latest cancer report, the incidence and mortality rates of CRC are both ranked top 5 among malignant tumors worldwide and continue to rise. Patients who receive treatment in the early stage (stage I) have a 5-year survival rate of approximately 90%. However, for high-risk stage II and III colorectal cancer patients, the 5-year survival rate is only 40%-70%, and almost half of the patients experience postoperative recurrence and metastasis.\n\nEvidence suggests that Stage III CRC patients can benefit from standard adjuvant chemotherapy. It is worth noting that some high-risk stage II patients, especially those with T4N0, have a poorer prognosis compared to stage IIIA (T1-2N+). Adjuvant chemotherapy is now also recommended for postoperative cases of high-risk stage II CRC. Given the high effectiveness of the three-drug FOLFOXIRI regimen in treating metastatic CRC and the success of adjuvant chemotherapy in treating pancreatic cancer, the combination of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan may have a synergistic effect.\n\nExtensive study results have shown that: (a) The status of ctDNA methylation after surgery is significantly correlated with patient prognosis, and patients who are positive for ctDNA methylation in the first 1-4 weeks after surgery (before adjuvant chemotherapy) have a poor prognosis. (b) Patients who are ctDNA methylation positive in the first 1-4 weeks after surgery (before adjuvant chemotherapy) can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, and achieving ctDNA methylation negativity through adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improves patient prognosis. This project focuses on exploring the optimized mode of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk stage II and III CRC guided by ctDNA methylation, which has high scientific and innovative value.\n\nThis multicenter, prospective, and randomized controlled cohort study uses a single-tube methylation-specific quantitative PCR (mqMSP) detection, which detects 10 different methylation markers and can quantitatively analyze plasma samples containing tumor DNA as low as 0.05%. This study will use this ctDNA methylation detection technology to perform quantitative detection of ctDNA methylation in the plasma of enrolled patients, and explore the effect of different chemotherapy regimens on ctDNA clearance rate and the prognostic value for ctDNA positive patients. We hope to screen out high-risk populations for recurrence through postoperative ctDNA testing, and administer more intensive chemotherapy regimens (chemotherapy upgrading) as early as possible to improve ctDNA clearance rate and patient prognosis.",

    "BriefSummary": "Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in infancy and childhood. The overall survival rate of retinoblastoma was reported to exceed 95% when children were early diagnosed with localized intraocular phase. The advanced retinoblastoma cases with central nervous system metastasis (CNS)is associated with exceedingly poor prognosis. CNS metastasis is the main cause of death in retinoblastoma. Meningeal involvement combined with spinal cord membrane involvement might be due to the meninges invasion and/or the spreading of CSF.\n\nAs the most sensitive drug to retinoblastoma tumor cells in vitro, melphalan is the most important drug in the local treatment of retinoblastoma, and it is also an irreplaceable drug in the current eye preservation treatment, which greatly improves the success rate of eye preservation for advanced retinoblastoma. According to the research and the practice of vitreous injection (melphalan), the drug concentration in vitreous can effectively kill retinoblastoma tumor cells.\n\nIt is reasonable to speculate that the tumor cells in CSF can be effectively killed by melphalan. Therefore, based on the above background, this study will explore the effectiveness and feasibility of intrathecal injection of melphalan in patients with CNS metastasis of retinoblastoma through a multicenter prospective study.",

    "BriefSummary": "Breast cancer is one of the main malignant tumors threatening women's lives. In recent years, the increasing demand for reconstruction of breast cancer patients in China has made the proportion of breast reconstruction increase year by year, while implant reconstruction has become the most important way of breast reconstruction due to its less injury, shorter time of operation and relatively simple surgical technique. In the long-term clinical practice, due to the lack of safe and effective alternative methods, the reconstruction method with prosthesis placed to posterior pectoralis major has been accepted by surgeons and patients, and has become the most commonly used method of prosthesis construction. However, the development of biomaterials provides new ideas for breast reconstruction. At present, more and more doctors in clinical practice discontinue the use of serratus anterior, but use the synthetic mesh (mostly titanium mesh TiLoop® Bra) or allogeneic acellular dermal matrix mesh to cover part of the dilator or prosthesis so as to shorten the entire operation cycle and make the appearance of the reconstructed breast more natural and aesthetic. In particular, it can improve the contour of the folds under the breast and shape the breasts with a certain degree of sagging.\n\nThis study takes the patients receiving immediate reconstruction with an implant combined with TiLoop® Bra after total mastectomy as the subjects, aiming to compare the aesthetics and safety of the placement of implant to anterior and posterior pectoralis major through a prospective and randomized study. The primary objective of the study is to analyze the aesthetics of breast appearance, patient satisfaction and postoperative quality of life (QOL) of the placement of implant to anterior and posterior pectoralis major. The secondary objective of the study is to analyze the incidence of complications and type of reoperation in both groups.",

Although the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors could improve the outcome of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC), chemotherapy has been the standard of care for systemic treatment for patients with mTNBC. Prognoses remain poor, with reported median overall survival estimates of approximately 18 months or less with available treatments. A meta-analysis of seven clinical trials showed that the median objective response rate (ORR) of second or later line of chemotherapy in mTNBC was only 11%.\n\nPatient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor model, which preserves the histologic and genetic characteristics of patients' tumors, has shown its predictive value of clinical outcomes and are used for preclinical drug evaluation, biomarker identification, biological studies, and personalized medicine strategies. However, long time period and low success rate has limited its application in clinical practice.\n\nMini patient derived xenograft (miniPDX) offers an effective alternative as it only takes about 7 days for drug sensitivity test and could thus provide guidance for prompt personalized treatment for each patient.\n\nThus, the investigators conduct this single-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical study to investigate the efficacy of guided treatment based on Mini-PDX in patients with metastatic refractory triple negative breast cancer.",

As a result, postnatal transition may be different at high altitudes. Umbilical cord blood gas analysis is now recommended in all high-risk deliveries because of its' value in providing information about preceding fetal hypoxic stress. But there are only limited studies about the SpO2 measurements during the first few hours after birth and umbilical blood gas analysis at high altitudes, especially at altitudes above 2500m. The primary outcome of the study is to determine the reference intervals for preductal oxygen saturation during first 2 hours of life stratified by different gestational age.

    "BriefSummary": "Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common tumors in otolaryngology. In China, it accounts for 1-5% of all malignancies and has an incidence of 1.13 per 100,000. Surgical resection is the most important treatment for patients who are not candidates for chemoradiotherapy or refuse chemoradiotherapy. The types of surgery include total and partial laryngectomy. Patients with laryngeal cancer often face multiple physical and psychiatric changes after surgery, such as daily large sputum production accompanied by cough, cleaning care of the air incision, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. Some patients do not actively exclude secretions due to pain, and the formation of sputum plugs causes lung inflammation, which is not conducive to postoperative recovery. Good postoperative pain management is beneficial to shorten the length of hospital stay and reduce mortality. Sufentanil is most commonly used for postoperative analgesia and has good analgesic effect, but there are some adverse effects, such as dizziness, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, skin itching, respiratory depression, etc. As a new type of analgesic, dezocine has been widely used in clinical practice with few adverse reactions to the respiratory and circulatory system, and its application to postoperative analgesia can significantly improve the immune activity. At present, there are not many studies on continuous analgesia of dezocine, mostly single-dose analgesia studies, this study for different doses of dezocine for the postoperative analgesic effect of laryngeal cancer patients, compared with the current classic opioid analgesics, to provide a new scheme for clinical medication.",

    "BriefSummary": "For patients with stage III colon cancers, radical resection of primary tumor followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is currently the standard treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin based regimen has been proved effective to improve recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Approximately half of patients with stage III colon cancers can be cured by surgery alone, while a substantial number of patients still experience recurrence, even with standard adjuvant chemotherapy. In recent years, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been detected in the cell-free component of peripheral blood samples in advanced colorectal cancers and many other solid tumors. Several previous studies have suggested that in patients with stage I-III colorectal cancer, postoperative ctDNA was an valuable biomarker to predict minimal residual disease (MRD) after radical resection, thus redefining patients risk outcome groups and guiding postoperative treatment. In addition, recent studies based on serial postoperative ctDNA detection showed that serial ctDNA analyses revealed disease recurrence up to 5-16.5 months ahead of radiological imaging. Here, based on the role of ctDNA in predicting MRD, we conducted an open, prospective, randomized controlled phase II cohort study to explore if ctDNA can as a biomarker to guide personalized surveillance strategy after surgery.",

The consistent association between pancreatic cancer and diabetes mellitus has long been recognized and even been termed as \"chicken and egg\". Many reports have found that pancreatic cancer can result in diabetes, which is called type 3c diabetes. New-onset diabetes is commonly observed in pancreatic cancer patients and has been considered as a potential screening sign. Moreover, diabetes has been found as a predictor of poor outcome in pancreatic cancer.\n\nPancreatic cancer cells have a strong dependence on glucose and they are well-known for their sweet teeth. High glucose is associated with impaired immunologic reaction, intolerability to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other major treatments, an increased risk of pancreatic surgery. Given the linkage between pancreatic cancer and diabetes or high blood glucose, a clinical trial is needed to validate the effect of metformin and insulin on regulating blood glucose in type 3c diabetes.",

Optimal PEEP is not only very different among individuals, but each individual's optimal PEEP is affected by positioning, muscle paralysis, and several other factors. Several techniques have been used to determine the optimal PEEP. For example, electrical impedance tomography(EIT)can be performed at the bedside.However, the application of this technique requires special training, increases the workload of the care team, and the cost-efficiencyof this procedure remains to be determined.We hypothesized that optimal PEEP could be obtained by titration of intraoperative PEEP levels and FiO2with SpO2 guidance. Our secondary hypothesis was that maintenance of intraoperative optimal PEEP derived via this method improves intraoperative oxygenation and reduces the incidence of postoperative hypoxemia.We tested our hypothesis in patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.",

    "BriefSummary": "Hypospadias is one of the most common genital malformations in children. The high incidence of hypospadias, which occurs in 1 in 200 to 300 live births, means that it affects a large number of patients. Surgery is the only way to repair hypospadias. Over 400 techniques have been described for hypospadias repair. However, the surgical success rate of hypospadias is still not ideal. Although the surgical success rate of distal hypospadias has reached more than 85%, the complications of proximal hypospadias are still as high as 30-68%. How to improve surgical skills and reduce the postoperative complications is quite a challenge for pediatric urologists.\n\nIn the preliminary clinical work, the investigators have tried to apply the technique of reconstructing forked corpus spongiosum (FCS) in hypospadias repair with urethral plate preservation. It has been confirmed that this technique was effective in reducing postoperative complications of this type of hypospadias repair. In order to promote the technology of reconstructing FCS, the investigators need to perform this technology in various types of hypospadias and evaluate its true effectiveness. Therefore, the investigators need to design a prospective, randomized, parallel-controlled, single-blind, and superior clinical trial to analyze the efficacy of reconstructing FCS in hypospadias repair.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will perform one-stage surgical repair on children with primary hypospadias by the same surgeon in Urology Department, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Participants will be random grouped: Routine standardized surgery with reconstructing FCS group and Routine standardized surgery group. All participants will be closely followed up and regularly evaluated after surgery, including postoperative complications, HOSE objective score of cosmetic outcome and voiding function. By collecting all data and conducting statistical analysis, the investigators will evaluate the followings: (1) the correlation between the penile curvature and the development of FCS; (2) the effect of reconstructing FCS on the complications of primary hypospadias repair; (3) the effect of reconstructing FCS on the cosmetic outcome; (4) the influence of reconstructing FCS on postoperative voiding function.\n\nBased on this clinical randomized controlled study, the investigators intend to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the new technology of reconstructing FCS in various types of hypospadias repair. The study will provide a reliable basis for the promotion of this technology for hypospadias repair in order to improve the quality of life for children with hypospadias.",
